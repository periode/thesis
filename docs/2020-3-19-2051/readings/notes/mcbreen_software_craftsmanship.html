<hr />
<p>summary</p>

<p>the whole book is about turning away from the engineer approach, and towards the craftsmanship approach, by putting the emphasis on people. this provides a useful framework for the <em>purpose</em> of beautiful code. it’s not just understanding in order to maintain but understanding in order to <em>learn</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>the book proposes to rethink software development from engineering to craftsmanship, moving from a focus on formal processes to a focus on <em>people</em>. the highlight of craftmanship asks the same question as sennett: knowledge transmission.</p>

<ul>
  <li>software is embodied intellectual capital, accumulated through the process of <em>figuring out the unknown</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Howard Baetjer sees the key challenge of software development as coordinating distributed learning and the key limitation as “our sheer ability to understand what it is we’re trying to do” -&gt; again, it is about TRANSMITTING UNCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE (learning, communication, negotiation process). and <strong>craftsmanship implies aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>historical shift from programming the computer (focusing on the machine), to programming for people</p>

<p>“software engineers use Ada, craftsmen use C”</p>

<p>all the <em>pragmatic programmer</em>, <em>elements of programming style</em>, <em>psychology of programming</em> books attempt at creating a tradition of software craftsmanship</p>

<p>claim that craftsmanship is personal in the work process, but collective in the work result</p>

<p><em>“make sure you understand the problem, then look long and hard for a solution, then test that solution on a small-scale first</em> -&gt; software craftsmanship builds systems that can be understood (again, claim)</p>

<p>trained technicians follow the book, master craftsmen ask lots of questions and then deliver what you really need (as opposed to what you asked for)</p>

<p>learning software development is different from learning how to program: it happens by trial and error, different from what they teach at schools (which is teaching sth out of its context)</p>
