<h2 id="introduction">introduction</h2>

<p>why is this an interesting subject? provides one aspect of the life of programmers, more about their concrete occupation than about their depiction from outside</p>

<p>arts&amp;craft movement have a profound distrust for the machine: that’s a difference
but a belief in “free” craftsmanship, which could echo stallman</p>

<p>craftsmanship/handicraft as opposed to manufacture <a href="https://archive.org/details/instinctworkman00veblgoog/page/n252/mode/2up">the instinct of worksmanship</a> + the place of the individual (but also not quite an opposition, a strange kind of contiuum)</p>

<p>also meritocracy! (same source as above, p.234)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The logic of this technology, accordingly, is the logic of the ma- chine process, — a logic of masses, velocities, strains and thrusts, not of personal dexterity, tact, training, and routine. In the degree in which the information that comes to hand comes encumbered with a teleological bias, a connotation of personal bent, it is imavailable or refractory imder this logic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from early handicraft, personal, polyvalent, to late handicraft, specialized, technical</p>

<h2 id="professed-similarities">1 - professed similarities</h2>

<p>this section inquires about the possible similarities on craftsmanship and software development, taking a historical look at both categories, and concluding a sub-category which might provide a link: building and architecture.</p>

<h3 id="a---overview-of-how-software-developers-view-their-relationship-to-craftsmanship">a - overview of how software developers view their relationship to craftsmanship</h3>

<ul>
  <li>early days: hackers and myths</li>
  <li>compulsivity in practice: weizenbaum</li>
  <li>uncle bob: clean code</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="b---parallel-throughout-history">b - parallel throughout history</h3>

<p>a specific time: late middle ages/renaissance, before automation happened, after the times in which craftsmanship was disregarded socially</p>

<ul>
  <li>middle-ages, builders, architects, guilds</li>
  <li>renaissance: optics, computers, tacit knowledge</li>
  <li>re-organization of work: artificiers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c---commentaries-today-architecture">c - commentaries today: architecture</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the cathedral and the bazaar</li>
  <li>patterns of software, patterns of space</li>
  <li>parallels with guilds and displacement of the hand-made (?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="knowledge-and-value-production">2 - knowledge and value production</h2>

<p>after having elucidated in what broad respects software development might be like craftsmanship, we highlight one specific aspect which asserts interesting tensions (both similarities and differences): knowledge acquisition and transmission</p>

<h3 id="a---knowledge-in-traditional-craft">a - knowledge in traditional craft</h3>

<ul>
  <li>short-circuit</li>
  <li>learning by doing and observing</li>
  <li>apprentices/masters</li>
  <li>cookbooks</li>
  <li>practice and repetition</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="b---knowledge-in-software-development">b - knowledge in software development</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ad hoc</li>
  <li>somewhat formalized, a lot self-taught</li>
  <li>learning by doing, not so much observing (paul graham, hackers and painters)</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>snippets of code on stack overflow?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>relationship to IP law? crafts and wares were signed, code as well. however, code can be hidden much more effectively.</li>
  <li>the bus factor</li>
  <li>the problem of documentation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c---diffuse-knowledge-hobbyists-and-amateurs">c - diffuse knowledge, hobbyists and amateurs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a cheap tool</li>
  <li>diffuse knowledge, resulting maybe in more hobbyism than expertise (the network society, cscw studies)</li>
  <li>still specific commununity online</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aesthetics">3 - aesthetics</h2>

<p>at the heart of knowledge transmission and acquisition stands the <em>practice</em>, and inherent in the practice is the <em>good practice</em>, the beautiful one. this section investigates the aesthetics of code within the broader context of the aesthetics of craftsmanship, highlighting how code can act as a material.</p>

<h3 id="a---the-aesthetics-of-craftsmanship">a - the aesthetics of craftsmanship</h3>

<ul>
  <li>pye</li>
  <li>sennett</li>
  <li>harold osborne</li>
</ul>

<p>the question of style</p>

<h3 id="b---the-aesthetics-of-code">b - the aesthetics of code</h3>

<ul>
  <li>functional beauty (also in osborne: the difference between fine arts and craftsmanship is selflessness, practical utility)</li>
  <li>clear, simple, elegant</li>
  <li>no ornament?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c---code-as-material">c - code as material</h3>

<ul>
  <li>essential complexity</li>
  <li>code smells, spaghetti, etc.</li>
  <li>the role of tools (terminal)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>

<p>there are some self-proclaimed similarities, but the most reliable/salient ones come from architecture and aesthetics, making the case for code as material.</p>
