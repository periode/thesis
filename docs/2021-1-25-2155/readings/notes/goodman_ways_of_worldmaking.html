<hr />

<p>a book about the fact that there are always multiple worlds made from existing worlds, and about how to define which worlds are “true” or “good”, and which ones aren’t.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="words-works-worlds">words, works, worlds</h4>

<p>there is no one one world, and if there are multiple worlds, there can always be seen as a collection of <em>one</em>.</p>

<p>so how do we define them, if there is no perception without conception, and no conception without perception?</p>

<p>if we look at worldmaking in developmental sociology or anthropology, a universal or necessary beginning is best found in theology.</p>

<p>processes of worldmaking are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>composition and decomposition (pp.7-9)</strong></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>taking apart, separating, analyzing complex components into simple features, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>changing predicates (e.g. applying something usually related to taste to sight) -&gt; <strong>changing metaphors</strong>  (he calls that metaphorical transfer)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>the question isn’t “same or not the same” but “same <em>what</em>”? -&gt; worlds aren’t different, but they <em>differ</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>taking apart also implies <strong>reassorting into kinds</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>weighting</strong></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>given things that are present in several worlds, some might be presented as very relevant, and others as completely irrelevant, through <em>emphasis</em> and <em>accent</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>these emphases are based on the departure from the relative prominence accorded to the several features in the current world of our everyday seeing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>hierarchies rather than dichotomies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>ordering</strong></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>what is first, and what is derived</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>spatial order of a map vs. temporal sequence of a trip</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>order is not <em>found into the world</em> but rather <em>built into it</em> (e.g. hours, seconds, millenia)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>deletion and supplementation</strong></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>supplementation is the whole from the fragments (gestalt)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>reshapings and deformation</strong></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>which can be considered either corrections or distortions, depending on the point of view</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>works of arts, though, characteristically illustrate, rather than name or describe relevant kinds. (p.11)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exemplification and expression, though running in the opposite direction from denotation—that is, from the symbol to a literal or metaphorical feature of it instead of to something the symbol applies to—are no less symbolic referential functions and instruments of worldmaking.” (p.12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>criteria for success in making a world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when it offends none of its unyielding beliefs (e.g. laws of logic, laws of physics, morals, immediately preceding observations) own precepts (i.e. is not self-contradictory in its chosen frames of reference)</li>
  <li>it’s not so much about <em>truth</em> as it is about <em>rightness</em></li>
  <li>and yet, while truth and reality might be relative, there is also the fact that some worlds are “false”, do not provide anything worth fighting for or against. (<em>“a broad mind is no substitute for hard work”</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>knowing is about finding a <em>fit</em>, about <strong>the advancement in understanding</strong>, and <strong>comprehension and creation go together</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As meanings vanish in favor of  certain relationships among terms, so fads vanish in favor of  certain relationships among versions. (p. 93)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>facts depend on habit</p>

<p>recognizable -&gt; <em>re-cognizable</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The artist’s resources-modes of reference, literal and  nonliteral. linguistic and nonlinguistic, denotational and non­ denotational, in many media-seem more varied and impressive  than the scientist. But the scientist is also poetic.</p>
