<p>mostly a book about NLP, CS &amp; linguistics. a prequel to <em>understanding computers and cognition</em>.</p>

<h4 id="viewing-language-as-a-knowledge-based-process">1. Viewing Language as a Knowledge-Based Process</h4>

<p>rules to understand language (p.8):</p>

<ul>
  <li>word order rules (syntax)</li>
  <li>vocabulary and word structure</li>
  <li>semantic features (a classification system of which a language user must be aware of)</li>
  <li>reference (e.g. what does it imply? difference between <em>a</em> city and <em>the</em> city)</li>
  <li>time (past, present, future)</li>
  <li>discourse structure (overall coherence)</li>
  <li>attitude messages (e.g. rhetorical question)</li>
  <li>prosody (intonation, inflexion, etc.)</li>
  <li>style conventions</li>
  <li>world knowledge &lt;- <strong>this might be interesting, since programming is about world representation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>survey of linguistic history:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prescriptive grammar, or linguistics as law. language as an enforced set of rules, focused on correctness or purity. is mostly wrong (for obv reasons)</li>
  <li>comparative grammar, or linguistics as biology/natural history. language as compared to other languages, to other linguistic structures, grouped in taxonomies, etc.)</li>
  <li>structural linguistics, or liinguistics as chemistry. language as made up of individual, structuring components (saussure)</li>
  <li>generative linguistics, or linguistics as mathematics. language as the result of the combinatorial mental capacities of the speaker (chomsky). the central problem is to define the <em>grammar</em> of a language (the set of procedures which confirm a statement as valid/true).</li>
</ul>

<p>the view of the book is that <strong>language is a communicative process based on knowledge</strong>. that’s because programming languages often seem to based on <em>computational linguistics</em>, or language as formal symbol manipulation (which turned out not to be true. or at least not effective compared to ML approaches)</p>

<p>the basic assumption is that there are <em>mental representations</em> in the user which can be represented as <em>data structures</em> in the computer.</p>

<p>if linguistic structure is stratified, eache strate still relates and connects to the stratas around it. this is related to the idea of <em>abstraction</em></p>

<p>sounds &lt;- -&gt; phonemes &lt;- -&gt; morphemes &lt;- -&gt; words &lt;- -&gt; syntax &lt;- -&gt; representations</p>

<p>(note: in <em>idioms</em>, it seems that words related directly to meaning rather than also word structure)</p>

<p>there is also a difference between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>long-term knowledge and temporary knowledge</li>
  <li>procedural representation (algorithm based) and declarative representation (data-structure based)</li>
</ul>

<p>approaches of linguistics can focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>text</li>
  <li>individual</li>
  <li>social</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>which of the above do i choose?</strong> (should i even choose? i’m guessing it’s quite obviously <em>text</em> since i’m focusing on source code)</p>

<p>limitations, because language is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>social</li>
  <li>evocative (aesthetics? def. literature)</li>
  <li>historical (re. social)</li>
</ul>
