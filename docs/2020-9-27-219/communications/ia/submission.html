<ul>
  <li>AI’s fiction: robots, cyborgs, computers; <strong>language</strong> amongst the computer scientists</li>
  <li>the cultural history of representations of AI and its inventors (Alan Turing for example); leibniz et. al.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">notes</h2>

<p>this contribution looks at how the early communities of AI development have built up a series of narratives around the power of language, and particularly logical language, and how assumptions about form and content allowed the development of modern computation and contemporary artificial intelligence.</p>
