<p>“HCI is complicated, with radically differring languages and where communication can only exist within frames of come compromises”</p>

<ul>
  <li>the market environment in which programmers exist</li>
</ul>

<p>they relate aesthetics to motivation, expert knowledge, comprehensive comprehension (they call it <strong>overcoming the problem of induction</strong>), software reliability (cause maintainability)</p>

<p>they focus on <em>intellectual aesthetics</em>, the aesthetics of learning and education (example of geometry as beautiful logic for plato)</p>

<p>what is beautiful makes sense.</p>

<p>more rigor = more beauty??</p>

<p>the recurring phrase for aesthetics in science is <strong>simplicity and vastness</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>taste and style in coding (write code as lit)</li>
  <li>aesthetic computing (the formal language <em>itself</em> is beautiful -&gt; start from the language, then develop the software)</li>
  <li>elegant software systems design (function follows form)
- - systemic elegance is related to systemic complexity
- - perceived elegance is related to hiding systemic complexity from the user (OOP, higher level languages have a higher perceived elegance)</li>
</ol>

<p>the question they ask is: can we use aesthetic appreciation as a sign of knowledge?</p>

<p>aesthetic and science are linked through intuition, combining information and imagination when making purposeful decisions regarding meaning and pleasure</p>

<p><em>Furthermore, aesthetic appreciation is a sign of motivation for continuous improvement of both code and education – the quest for elegance is one for optimality, since in algebraic aesthetics beauty is recognized as perfection. Desire for beauty leads to striving for excellence. Aesthetic feeling is an intrinsic reward for programming efforts and can significantly accelerate goal-related learning and external reward intake</em></p>

<p>there is teaching beauty, and there is teaching beauty in relation to computer programs</p>
