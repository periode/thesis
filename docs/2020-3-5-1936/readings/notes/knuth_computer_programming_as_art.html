<p>## donald knuth
### 1974</p>

<p>art means skill in latin (<em>ars, artis</em>), and in greek the equivalent is <em>techne</em></p>

<p>liberal arts used to include logic, arithmetic and geometry (essential to CS)</p>

<p>if science is the knowledge, then arts is the application of knowledge (kinda like today’s science and engineering)</p>

<p>john stuart mill: we need multiple sciences for a single art</p>

<p>john rushkin: <em>the work of science is to subsitute facts for appearances and demonstrations for impressions</em></p>

<p>art is that which is hard to automate: can you automate code-writing? what’s the status of the research on that?</p>

<p>the goal is the synthesis of science and art</p>

<p><em>i don’t know anything about art, but i know what i like</em></p>

<p>therefore comes the question: what is good style? what is bad style?</p>

<p><strong>the important thing is that they are creating something <em>they</em> feel is beautiful</strong></p>

<p>bentham: the <strong>utility</strong> of the result is a reliable standard for aesthetic jugment. but this utility can also simply be tied back to <em>pleasure</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>IT WORKS CORRECTLY</li>
  <li>IT IS EASY TO CHANGE</li>
  <li>THE ABOVE IS ACHIEVED THROUGH READABILITY</li>
</ol>

<p>should we care about program efficiency? (cpu cycles, battery usage, etc.). mass storage def affects some sort of beauty</p>

<p>in the end, it’s important to have beautiful <em>tools</em> to work with: we can write code forever if the machine/infrastructure on which we write it is pleasurable</p>

<p>he mentions program measurement as an important aspect of writing beautiful code: what happened to program measurement in the 21st century?</p>

<p>and then of course language design</p>
