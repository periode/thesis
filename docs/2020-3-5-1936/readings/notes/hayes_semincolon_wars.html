<p>everyone wants a new progrmaming language to make it “better” but we haven’t figured out what “good” even is</p>

<p>semi-colons can be statement <em>separators</em> (algol, pascal don’t need a ; after the last statement) or <em>terminators</em> (C does need that last ;)</p>

<p>and then comments: how to write them, <em>can they be nested?</em></p>

<p><strong>the real criterion in programming languagesis how readily you can express your ideas</strong></p>

<p>imperative languages: <em>do this, do that</em>, they act on stored data, modifying the global state of the system. this used to be the default in early languages (fortran, cobol, algol)</p>

<p>functional languages: based on mathematical functions, wiht always an input and an output (clean in/out)</p>

<p>oop: bind together the commands and the data into encapsulated objects</p>

<p>declarative languages: states facts and relations (used in <code>prolog</code> but also in databases or spreadsheets)</p>

<p>structured programming aka bondage and discipline (e.g. <code>pascal</code>), which has strong typedef and strong controlflow. the reaction against those constraints produced “hacker-friendly” languages, such as C</p>

<p>but exactly: if C has less constraints, how often do we see beautiful C code? is it that hacking something is always going to be somewhat ugly? do we need to <em>work with</em> the constraints of the language in order to write beautiful code?</p>

<p>and then finally there are applications (science, education, etc.)</p>

<p>in classical mathematics, there was also the debate between leibniz’s <code>dx/dt</code> and newton’s <code>x-dot</code>.</p>

<p><code>python</code> and <code>ruby</code>: scripting languages moving from “glue” scripts to general-purpose languages</p>

<p>the author finds beauty in lisp’s <strong>uniformity</strong>: data and programs are represented in the same way</p>

<p><em>When you get to the bottom of it, however, I write programs in Lisp for the same reason I write prose in English—not because it’s the best language, but because it’s the language I know best.</em></p>
