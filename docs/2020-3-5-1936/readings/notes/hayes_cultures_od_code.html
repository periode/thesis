<p>three cultures:
1. computer science (understand computation)
2. computational sciences (simulate behaviour of science to understand nature)
3. software development (write useful programs)</p>

<p>the focus here is on software development, but other cultures can help understanding what can make it beautiful. this is focus is because in software development <em>the program itself is the product of the labor</em>, not some means.</p>

<p>Michael Mahoney: the agenda of a field is what practicioners agree on what the goal is (with problems, priority, tools, solutions)</p>

<p>the common area of research, or at least the venn overlap is <em>programming languages</em> (central is the question: “what is the expressive power of a language?”)</p>

<p>higher level programming languages are <em>closer to the vocabulary of the problem domain that of the minutiae of the hardware</em></p>

<p>slogans:
- modularity
- abstraction
- encapsulation
- declarative programming
- functional programming
- oop
- design patterns
- tdd
- agile</p>
