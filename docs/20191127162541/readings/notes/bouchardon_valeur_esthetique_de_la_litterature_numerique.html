<p>## serge bouchardon</p>

<p>digital literature exists in the wake of things like:
- combinatorial lit (oulipo)
- constraint lit (idem)
- fragment lit (?)
- audio/visual lit</p>

<p>literary experiments (-&gt; which implies that the experiment is the first intent, no? could it be that art flourishes on the margin, like the hacker code of paloque berges?)</p>

<p>literary expression: writing, narrative, position of the reader</p>

<p><strong>what has source code writing to offer when it comes to literary creation?</strong> (and vice-versa)</p>

<p>the digital only refers to itself (yes, but the digital is inseparable from the act of writing, which then involves a human and therefore necessarily (?) a relationship to other worlds). but also the very first thing is hardware</p>

<p>form and meaning are closely linked (cf. j. rousset, <em>forme et signification</em>, 1966)</p>

<p>the bizarre love triangle of media studies:
- <strong>technically</strong>
- <strong>semiotically</strong>
- <strong>socially</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the theoretical object (theory) vs./and the technical object (source code)</li>
  <li>the observable reality (form) vs./and the inner practice (interpretation)</li>
  <li>kind of production (the work) vs./and a political ideal (the limits of computability?)</li>
</ul>

<p>source code could be a <em>particular modality/mode</em> of text (now i need to define which one!)</p>

<h3 id="mark-marino-critical-code-studies">mark marino: critical code studies!</h3>

<p><em>“possesses aesthetic properties everything which sets in motion, which makes do (fait faire)”</em></p>

<p>relationship between literature and communication??</p>

<p><em>“the interrogative stance can not only stand in what has been done, but also in what can be anticipated, through conception and creation”</em> (epistemological constructivism, hacking, 1983). <em>“the creative moment sets up the conditions to observe a phenomenon”</em></p>
