<hr />

<p>the whole text tries to make a connection between programmer and artist, forgetting that theyâ€™re both <em>artesans</em> (craftspeople)</p>

<p><strong>i need to highlight the difference between programmers and artists in order to validate the craftsmanship hypothesis above</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>question of the work of programming as the work of an artist</p>

<p>ugly code is first expressed in the context of <strong>students</strong> (poorly indented, not documented, inappropriate data structures, inappropriate variable names, etc.)</p>

<p>what knuth means when he says programming is art is that it is <em>the mastery of complexity through consistency</em> (and hopefully conciseness)</p>

<p>having multiple choices when working on a non-trivial program implies that we have to make use of imagination and creativity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>programming is communication, with the computer, and with other people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>aesthetics also help <em>the writer</em> to understand what they are trying to communicate (cf. computer as a prosthetic organ for philosophy)</p>

<p>the biggest difference between art and programming is the criterion of <em>usefulness</em></p>

<p>the other criterion presented do not give normative prescriptions (e.g. how many indentations, etc.)</p>
