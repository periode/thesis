<p>is coding literacy something that is motivated primarily by the socio-economic embedding of code or is it in general an “improvement” in human cognition?</p>

<p>we are humanizing thoughts and processes</p>

<p>evolution: from storage to memory (von neumann’s jump)</p>

<p>the more human languages you know, the more you know about writing literacy, so the more programming languages you know, the better/more ideal it is [[table_of_contents#4 2 - the programming language ecosystems]]</p>

<p>clean coding? don’t think that everyone should go that route (messy writing is fine too)</p>
