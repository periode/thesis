<blockquote>
  <p>For millennia, ancient Eastern construction practices like the Indian vaastu shastra and the Chinese feng shui offered concrete guides to creating spatial harmony and aesthetic coherence in the built environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>architectural beauty and coherence exist</p>

<p>neuroscientifical studies in artistic experience/aesthetic perception have started, but havenâ€™t quite found conclusions yet.</p>

<p>however, three systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sensori-motor</li>
  <li>knowledge/meaning</li>
  <li>emotion/valuation</li>
</ul>

<p>how does the architectural aesthetic experience differ from the visual aesthetic? and from the coding?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grouping, a fundamental Gestalt principle, describes the process by which the visual system orders repeated, statistically correlated information in a scene, like alternating columns and archways in an architectural colonnade or organized pat- terns of blue and yellow hues dispersed throughout a stained glass window</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grouped features (e.g., of color or form) trigger synchronized action potentials among associated neurons responsible for processing those features (Ramachandran &amp; Hirstein, 1999; Singer &amp; Gray, 1995)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>paterns with more symmetries enable more efficient recognition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More recent evidence suggests that the relationship between complexity and aesthetic preference varies as a function of how the former is conceptualized (e.g., amount, variety or organization of elements within a scene; Nadal, Munar, Marty, &amp; Cela-Conde, 2010)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the above could explain how different types of complexity (one-liner, obfuscation, PLs), have different followings</p>
