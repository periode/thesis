<p><em>sensation, perception</em> &gt; how does it make us feel?</p>

<p><em>an object with aesthetic properties is an objects that makes something (a sensation? a feeling?) happen</em></p>

<p>poetry questions our approach to (natural/machine) language (<em>through what? interactivity? sound? color? typography? …mental structures</em>)
literature is the aesthetic usage of written language (tresor de la langue francaise)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/778936">adorno - the form of the phonograph record</a>: the artwork only holds “truth-content”, has fragments of true language once life has left it. it is, in a sense a threat to life/a judgment upon life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>art works to shape our basic sense of what is and what matters <em>in all of life</em> (heidegger)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="poetics">poetics</h2>

<p>linguistic -&gt; language vs. poetics -&gt; discourse</p>

<p>is about <em>understanding</em> coherence, about <em>understanding</em> structure, and <em>understanding</em> pre-existing patterns (if poetics are prototypes, aesthetics are instances, maybe interfaces). it “an internal theory of literature”, a conjuction of categories, but also a general direction from an author (not sure how that is different from the aesthetics?)</p>

<p><em>poetics will be called upon to elaborate a theory of description that will bring to light not only what all descriptions have in common but also what permits them to remain different</em> (todorov) - but it must also provide instruments to identify such occurences of, here, a description</p>

<p>a poetics of beautiful code -&gt; what is beautiful code?
an aesthetics of beautiful code -&gt; how is code beautiful?</p>

<p>aesthetics are somewhat isolating, but at the same time connecting. <em>it isolates from the immediate, and then connects to the indirect</em></p>

<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/architecture/">plato</a></p>

<p>“The aesthetics of architecture, by itself, spans traditional issues mooted in philosophy of art, as well as aesthetics of the everyday, and environmental aesthetics. Such traditional issues include <strong>the nature of the work; the possibility of classes, kinds, or types in the domain; the character and roles of representation, intentionality, and expression; and the warranted foundations for criticism</strong>.”</p>

<p>In distinct progressive and utopian traditions in architectural thought (Eaton 2002), advancement of social utility is a central motivation in architectural attempts to realize idealistic visions of modes of living and societal organization.</p>

<p>“In general, when a thing becomes useful, it ceases to be beautiful” -Théophile Gauthier, Préface des premières poésies, 1832.</p>
