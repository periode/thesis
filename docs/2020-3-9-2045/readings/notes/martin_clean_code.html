<p>## robert c. martin
### prentice hall, pearson education, 2008</p>

<p>the author is one of the main creators of the Agile Manifesto, and a leading figure in professional software development. The book is written with <code>JAVA</code>.</p>

<p>software architecture can draw its parallels from japanese 5S:
- seiri ( +- naming, details)
- seiton ( +- putting things where they belong)
- seiso ( +- clean)
- seiketsu ( +- standardization, consistency)
- shutsuke ( +- self-discipline (opposite of emotional programming?))</p>

<p>“we had some back-of-the-enveloped findings indicating that suggested that consistent indentation style was one of the most statistically significant indicators of low-bug density”</p>

<p>style distinguishes excellence from competence, and it is beauty, but <em>what kind of beauty</em>? is clean code beautiful code? what is the step to beauty? beauty could/should also be seen as some sort of efficiency. something beautiful is something that is <em>efficient</em> at communicating sth (sth = a task, a concept)</p>

<p>why does bad code even exist? lack of experience? external constraints? lack of knowledge (is that the same as lack of experience?)</p>

<h4 id="definitions-by-authors">definitions by authors</h4>

<ul>
  <li>bjarne soustrup (c++ creator): “clean code does one thing well” + clean code is efficient, <strong>and pays attention to details</strong></li>
  <li>grady brooch: “<em>crisp abstraction</em>”, clean code should be like a fiction, with setting up tensions and clearly solving them into a “a-ha!” moment. <strong>code should be matter of fact rather than speculative</strong> (that’s opposed to all the software art field)</li>
  <li>dave thomas: code should be read by others, have minimal dependencies and APIs, and should be literate (cf. kunth - literate programming)</li>
  <li>michael feathers: code that has been cared for: SIMPLE AND ORDERLY</li>
  <li>ron jeffries: no duplication. minimized (and not minified). <strong>expressiveness goes beyond words</strong></li>
  <li>ward cunningham: “you can call it beautiful code when it looks like the language was made for the problem” &gt; it is not the language that makes the program appear simple, but the programmer that makes the language appear simple</li>
</ul>

<p>the <code>@author</code> field of a Javadoc leaves no doubt as to who is doing what act (writing, for a group of readers)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>expressiveness goes beyond words</strong></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="naming">naming</h4>

<ul>
  <li>they should reveal intent</li>
  <li>they should not add <strong>NOISE</strong> (refer to shannon as noise + semantics)</li>
  <li>pronounceable names (human-oriented, which then can enmable conversations)</li>
  <li>do not try to please the compiler (aka change only one letter in a var name to allow for compilation -but there is also clever code, which takes into account the compiler, cf. the perl poem in which the mythical programmer knew the compiler better, except now we don’t know compilers so much anymore)</li>
  <li>no artificial encoding (e.g. Hungarian Notation)</li>
  <li>say what you mean, mean what you say</li>
  <li>lexicon can come from the <em>problem-domain</em> (real world) or <em>solution domain</em> (software engineering world)</li>
  <li>pay attention to context: place variables in the correct context, and if there isn’t create such a context (comments)</li>
</ul>

<p>names require a shared contextual background, rather than program-linguistic background.</p>

<h4 id="functions">functions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>do not mix multiple levels of abstraction</li>
  <li>make functions small (verbatim: in a beautiful program, “each told a story”)</li>
  <li>functions should have at best 0 arguments. maybe 1, perhaps 2, rarely more.</li>
  <li>kinda disagree about flags in functions (he says we should have no flags and separate functions. how is this not a version of cognitive overload? how are flags not a way to abstraction?)</li>
</ul>

<p>coupling: degree of dependence between software modules (cna be temporal)</p>

<p>“the art of programming is the art of language design” - to what extent is literature language design?
“the real goal is to tell the story of the system”</p>
