<p>he talks about <em>text-based aesthetics</em>… does that correspond to literature?</p>

<p>metaphors used in software:
- “looping around a section”
- “walking through code”
- “piping X into Y”
- “forking”
- etc.</p>

<p>but his issue is that none of these have been made <em>visual</em>, there all just cognitive or conjectural, and exist as <strong>mental models</strong>. he says that you can only have aesthetics qualities if you free those mental models from your mind, “trapped inside complex software representations”.</p>

<p><em>finite state machine as metaphor</em></p>

<p>static vs. dynamic</p>

<p>his actual grasp of aesthetic is limited to “choose between Magritte and Kandinsky”, but his point of aesthetics being needed to grasp the metaphor is useful.</p>

<p>the metaphor he proposes is that of the business floor, with people queueing for different booths. it echoes von neumann’s statement that a computer is just bureaucracy.</p>

<p>the <em>Unified Modeling Language</em> is more about software engineering than programming. in general, there is definitely a difference between those two, programming being a lower-level, hands-on version of engineering.</p>

<p>another paradigm: <strong>programming by example</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>he argues that there is no absolute intrinsic value in minimal representation; “it is one of the many aesthetic points in a magnificently large space of possibilities”</p>

<hr />

<p>references to constructivism and bauhaus</p>
