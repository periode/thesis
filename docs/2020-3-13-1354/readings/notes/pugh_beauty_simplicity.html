<hr />
<p>summary</p>

<p>a reaction to the <em>Coding Guidelines</em> article by Green and Ledgard arguing that there are different levels of aesthetics, that they treat of surface level ones while leaving aside semantic ones.</p>

<hr />

<p>disappointed by the highlight on the “alignment, naming, use of white space, use of context, syntax highlighting, and IDE choice” by Green and Ledgard in <em>Coding Guidelines</em>.</p>

<p>“there is a more compelling beauty in the deeper semantic properties of code than layout and naming”
&gt; abstraction
&gt; balancing precision and generality
&gt; elegant structure of class hierarchy
&gt; balance between breadth and depth
&gt; order of parameter lists
&gt; leverage library code with minimal effort</p>

<p><strong>formalizing such semantic properties is more difficult than coding conventions</strong></p>

<p>ralph waldo emerson: “we ascribe beauty to that which is simple; which has no superfluous patterns; which exactly answers its ends; which stands related to all things; which is the means to many extremes”.</p>

<hr />

<p>in the same column, a discussion of the C one-liner:
<code>while (*s++ = *t++)</code></p>

<p>translated into assembly:
<code>
A mov (@R0)++,(@R1)++
    bne A
</code></p>

<p>which was beautiful and elegant as it was running in the PDP-11 at the time, but the condition that enabled it (having null-terminated strings) makes it a lot harder to write C code today.</p>

<hr />

<p>why do we compute?</p>

<p>Richard Hamming, Bell Labs: <em>“we compute because we want to know and understand”</em></p>
