<p>the most recent and referenced textbook in programming languages for software developers</p>

<hr />

<p>Semantics is the <strong>decoration</strong> of parse trees/ASTs (which is the process of evaluating attributes, which can be either <em>synthesized</em> or <em>inherited</em>)</p>

<p>Since decoration is the addition of a new layer (a semantic layer) on top of a base layer (a syntactic one), then this leads to some sort of <em>meta</em>-programming. It happens at a higher level, indeed, but it is still restrained to the fact that it is, indeed, programming (therefore syntax based?).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attribute grammars do not really specify the meaning of a program; rather,they provide a way to associate a program with something else that presumablyhas meaning (p.167)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>denotational semantics (refer to the domain theory, where they point to something)</li>
  <li>axiomatic semantics (intransitive)</li>
</ul>

<p>synthesized: attributes are given only on the left side
inherited: attributes are calculated on the right side, and depend on the current context</p>
