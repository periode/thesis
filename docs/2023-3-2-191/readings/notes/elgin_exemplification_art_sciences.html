<hr />

<p>To highlight, underscore, display or convey involves reference as well as instantiation. An item that, at once refers to and instantiates a features may be said to exemplify that feature. e.g. a class cna exemplify encapsulation; a sample problem worked out in a textbook exmplifies reasoning strategies to be used in the course.</p>

<p>XXXX exemplifies codeâ€™s capacity to YYYY</p>

<p>Therefore, an example affords epistemic access to the features it exemplifies. But not always! something can be an instance of something else, but not be telling/provide no epistemic access to.</p>

<p>The features a symbol exemplifies depends on its function (or, more precisely, its functional context): a symbol can perform a variety of function: a piece of code in a textbook might exemplify an algorithm, while the same piece of code in production software might be seen as a liability, or as a boring section in a code poem.</p>
