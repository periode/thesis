<p>literary works not only say something, but they other do other things: they mean in <em>other</em> ways. ex: music and architecture only have style?</p>

<p>so we might think the obvious distinction is between what (subject) and how (style), but the subject is to certain extent part of the style: it affects the style.</p>

<p>different ways of saying the same thing / same way of saying different things.</p>

<p>“writing about battles of the renaissance, or writing about the paintings of the renaissance are two different ways of writing about the renaissance” -&gt; talking about something more comprehensive that embraces both</p>

<p>style can be:
- lexicon
- structural
- formal (rhythm, alliteration)
- <strong>predominance of certain kinds of [insert feature]</strong></p>

<p>some say that style begins when facts stops and feelings start: but emotions are an incomplete part of style, and style can’t be reduced to emotions</p>

<p>saying: explicit AND expressing: implicit AND exemplifying: sample-reference</p>

<p>the features, whether structural or non-structural, are all properties exemplified by a work.</p>

<p>a “property” can be either a statement made, a structure presented, or a feeling conveyed, or even a socio-historical belonging.</p>

<p>in the end, style is <strong>a property of the functioning work as a symbol</strong> (symbol of what? symbol as stand-in for something being “meaningful”, <em>while being engrained in the time/place/identity</em>)</p>

<p>style must be intentional, in that it <em>fits</em> in a broader network of symbolism.</p>

<p>style must be understood/analyzed by those who “know”</p>

<p>“placing a work is in itself aesthetically significant insofar as it makes for discovery of stylistic properties”</p>
