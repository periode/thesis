<h4 id="orality-of-language">orality of language</h4>

<p>“we’ve all heard that an image is worth a thousand words. but if that’s true, why make it a saying?”</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is undeniable. you can only exist as a written language if you’ve been spoken. what about (source-)coded? you can only be coded if you’re written</li>
</ul>

<p>all thought is analytic: is divides its object in smaller elements.</p>

<p>writing has <em>extended</em> orality, by turning oral art into a “scientific” art</p>

<p>there is no such thing as “oral literature”</p>

<h4 id="modernity-discovering-primary-orality">modernity discovering “primary orality”</h4>

<p>researchers would attribute to oral poetry the qualities that made sense within their own standards</p>

<p>orality is parataxical (contextual) and aggregative (rather than sequential, rigorous, deductive)</p>

<p>orality has its own specific means of expression, and greek oral philosophy is already influenced by the written word</p>

<p>the move from the “savage mind” to the “rational mind” (levi-strauss) has been shown by goody to have been a switch between oral thinking to written thinking</p>

<h4 id="psychodynamics-of-orality">psychodynamics of orality</h4>

<p>we know what we remember: mnemotechnics and formulas</p>

<p>it helps to recall (oneself), and then to restitute (someone else)</p>

<ul>
  <li>phrasing is coordinated, rather than subordinated</li>
  <li>phrasing is aggregated (works with chunks, wholes) rather than analytical (works with parts): it is <em>totalizing</em> (levi-strauss). even the sense of hearing is a sense which thrives towards the <em>unification</em> of all things (whereas sight and taste discriminate)</li>
  <li>phrasing is repeating: repeating maintains both the speaker and the audience in the same path</li>
  <li>phrasing is conservative (slower evolution)</li>
  <li>phrasing is contextual (close to everyday life)</li>
  <li>phrasing is agonistic, it doesn’t separate she who knows from what she knows (it’s the opposite with writing, you can always “quote”). these agonistic exchanges were then the basis for the greek art of rhetorics</li>
  <li>empathetic and participatory rather than distantiated, it has a close connection with knowledge</li>
  <li>phrasing is homeostatic: it belongs to and maintains the <em>present</em> (getting rid of the past which has no relationship to reality —the integrity of the past is overcome by the integrity of the present)</li>
  <li>phrasing is situational, rather than abstract (cf. context vs. analysis) -&gt; unique words in close communities vs. compound words in distant communities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>oral communication gathers and unites people</strong> (through the unity of sound, of conscious emitting and receiving of sound)</p>

<p>example: “it is by seeing one that one knows which color a bear is”
example: “can you explain to me what a tree is?” “to do what?”</p>

<p>auto-analysis is hard for oral peoples, since this requires some sort of distancing from the self</p>

<p><em>de même que les lettrés prêtent aux interprètes oraux des talents de lettrés, les interprètes oraux prêtent aux lettrés des talents caractéristiques de l’oralité</em></p>

<p>memorization is under the influence of social pressure: one remembers what the audience wants to hear</p>

<p>nature doesn’t have “facts”: these only come from imagined statements by humans to refer to the homogeneous network of the realities which surround them.</p>

<p>le lectorat vs. l’auditoire</p>

<h4 id="writing-restructures-the-mind">writing restructures the mind</h4>

<p>it transformed the human consciousness</p>

<p>texts are by nature unchained (insoumis) -one cannot <em>talk</em> to the author</p>

<p>plato:
- writing is inhumane
- it destroys memory
- a written text does not react
- a written text cannot defend itself</p>

<p>paradoxically, it is because plato could write that he could articulate his thoughts against phonocentrism</p>

<p>the paradox is that the text’s inertia, its withdrawal from the actual world, its rigidity, all this guarantees that <em>it will endure</em> in a lot of different contexts</p>

<p>writing is <strong>a coded system of visible marks, through which a writer can determine the precise words that a reader would generate from a text</strong> (that’s a very social definition of writing, even if you’re talking/writing to yourself). there is a requirement of universal humanity for the functioning of speech (from soul to soul)</p>

<p>communication is intersubjective, but the medium isn’t (it’s just inter-, i guess)</p>

<p>grammaire &gt; grimoire &gt; livre de magie (magic book)</p>

<p>goody studied the poetry of tables and lists (calendars, etc.). example of the torah</p>

<p>boustrophédon: reading C code  in spirals</p>

<p>the novel took some time to create a fictional stance for the reader (after having worked on genres, character development and plot development). in <em>finnegan’s wake</em>, the role of the reader is that of the fictional reader.</p>

<p>modern, written english has been worked on for five century by clerks and scholars</p>

<p>but still, oral remains</p>

<h4 id="print-space-and-closure">print, space and closure</h4>

<p>space and meaning:
- the index (lists)
- the book as container (therefore needs a cover page)
- signifying surface (illustration and technical verbalization allow for the development of science)
- typographical space (layout becomes a mean of expression: <em>blank space</em>)</p>

<p>print also developed private life (private reading, easier to carry, easier to get lost in it), along with private property: typography becomes a product (and a product which doesn’t deal well with the unfinished)</p>

<p>print also gave birth to the ideas of originality and creativity (things that “come out of nowhere”)</p>

<p>the “public of readership” is composed of readers who follow the continuous, coherent train of though of a distant writer, and could accept her perspectives</p>

<p>as for the digital, it introduced us into “secondary orality”:
- participatory
- collective
- present moments
- formulas (memes)</p>

<p>we are facing the outside (social selves, presentation), because through writing we’ve already faced the inside</p>

<h4 id="oral-memory-plot-and-characterizing">oral memory, plot and characterizing</h4>

<p>of course, storytelling changed not just because of oral-&gt;written, but also because of religious, political and cultural exchanges, among others</p>

<p>-&gt; the whole section is about the metamorphosis of storytelling (poets, bards)</p>

<p><em>the original voice of the oral narrator has taken on different shapes by becoming the silent voice of the writer, while the distance introduced by writing invited different kinds of fictionalization of both the reader and the writer decontextualized</em></p>

<p>the heroic deeds of the oral hero have been replaced by the inner, subjective conscience of the written hero. the “three-dimensional character” is a product of writing, a psychological mechanism that is dependent on our medium for expression. in History, we’ve moved from accounts of battles to accounts of psyches.</p>

<p>and now avant-garde lit has to destructure or blur out its stories, cause it’s fckn lost :(</p>

<h4 id="some-ideas">some ideas</h4>

<p>romanticism and technology go hand in hand (cf. new criticism)</p>

<p>all text is built on a pre-text</p>

<p>to be interpreted, it must possess a <strong>link</strong> (lien) with the reader (<em>what is the nature of that link?</em>)</p>

<p>“against” structuralism: the ability to mend mistakes and pick up as one goes (oral poet) is one thing that distinguishes the expert from the incompetent.</p>

<p><strong>the challenge is to understand reception in the light of our knowledge regarding the evolution of noetic processes since primary orality until advanced literacy</strong> and next? speech, writing, code</p>
