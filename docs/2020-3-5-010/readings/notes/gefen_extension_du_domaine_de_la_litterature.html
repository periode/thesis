<ul>
  <li>problem of the uniqueness of “litterarity”, of the identity of literature</li>
  <li>each text was supposed to be approached mostly historically, as a single entity, with its most important part being “originality”, and escaped any relation to the rest of the world</li>
</ul>

<p>today, we think we’ve moved away from self-referentiality, from formalism, from <em>the canon</em>. but in reality, not so much.</p>

<p>if there is chronological extension, what other kinds of extensions are there? because it extends between journalism and literature, anthropology and literature, history and literature… it def goes beyond <em>fiction</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is no longer a matter of pointing out the specificities of the literary in certain texts, but highlight those that question this specificities. that live indeed at the boundary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>literature studied through the lens of “problems” (feminism, exile, memory, etc.), a practical perspective.</li>
  <li>
    <p>literature studied not as a set of <em>texts</em> but as a set of <em>activities</em>. it even gets closer to a study of a particular media (the written text), a study of particular supports/materials</p>
  </li>
  <li>in order to get out of this “trap”, one should look into multiple interpretations of the literary fact, coming from cognitive sciences, cultural anthropology, or educational theories (goodman/<strong>dewey talking about how literature should be a means rather than an end</strong>)</li>
</ul>
