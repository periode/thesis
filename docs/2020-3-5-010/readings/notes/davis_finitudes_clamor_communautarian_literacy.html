### college composition and communication, 2001</p>

<p>rhetoric has this myth of the self-contained, self-necessary subject. “the construct of the self-directed student, who stands at the center of their own thoughts”</p>

<p>critical and feminist pedagogies call to “identify” to whom they write and speak within the networks of gender, class, and power”, <em>encourage self-consciousness about who they are and can be in the social world</em>. (still about the self, tho)</p>

<p>the myth of self-presence, there is a certain <em>will-to-immanence</em>, purity</p>

<p><em>Sharing (that is: community) takes place not among similarly positioned subjecthoods-subjects share no/thing as subjects-but (only) at the extreme and exposed limit of subjectivity, where (a finite) being irrepressibly exceeds itSelf.</em> &gt; give up on yourSelf to meet others</p>

<p>the clamor of social communication. a community that cannot be produced but exposed.</p>

<p>the doxa is that the cartesian split forces us to appreciate the world subjectively, starting from “I” and looking at all things through social norms/frames of reference/signs/mental categories/etc.</p>

<p>for both expressivists (I <em>constitute</em> reality) and cognitivists (I <em>represent</em> reality) and social constructionists (the community <em>shapes</em> me according to the world), the starting point is to get in touch with the inner self. they all presume we exist first a singular beings, not as always-already-<em>with</em>-others</p>

<p>Kent hypothesizes: “thoughts and mental states derive from the external world of communicative interaction” (Paralogic Rhetoric)</p>

<p>“without the other, we can have no thoughts, no language, no cognizance of meaning, no awareness that we possess something we call mental states” (still Kent) &gt; meaning is made in a community of “communicative interaction”</p>

<p>Davidson: triangulation: contributing to knowledge of her own mind, knowledge of other minds, and knowledge of a shared world</p>

<p>meaning is a function of communicative interaction, which requires “on-the-spot interpretations”</p>

<p>it’s related to the idea of the voice in politics (the illusion of the singular, the always-in-relation)</p>

<hr />

<p>re: these kinds of papers: paying attention, to the small, to the detail, to the insignifiant, to that which is overlooked/looked down upon by dominant frames of understanding, is politically important.</p>

<hr />

<p>there is always pre-writing. and so writing is the beginning of dying (cixous), because the writer encounters her finitude (exposed, ruptured, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>interpretation takes a back seat to exposition</strong></p>

<p>“i hear in it that the other speaks”, which leads to excessive hospitality, humble receptivity</p>

<p>writing “to the point” promotes the “western tradition of assertion and support” (somewhat agree: perhaps those traditions have more to do with the switch to writing? linear, logical)</p>
