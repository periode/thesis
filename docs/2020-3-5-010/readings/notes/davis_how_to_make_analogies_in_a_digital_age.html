### OCTOBER 117, 2006</p>

<p>essentially a long paper on the relationship between analog and digital, particularly in the light of goodman’s <em>languages of art</em>.</p>

<p>there isn’t really a distinction between analog and digital, according to nelson.</p>

<p>and von neumann said that the digital might be embedded in the analgo, and vice-versa. the “fineness” which results in digitality only happens by going through transient states.</p>

<p>the example of mount fuji as an analog (mark making as pictorial scheme, in which <em>there is no</em> syntactic or semantic differentiation—as opposed to scripts, or scores, for instance)</p>

<p>“a [symbol] scheme is syntactically dense if it provides for infinitely many characters so ordered that between each two there is a third.” -&gt; infinitization and interminability. everything matters.</p>

<p>what Richard Wollheim calls the two-foldness of pictorial representation, its requirement that we attend both to the inscription (typically a flat painted surface) and to the projected correlate (such as a figured scene) in order fully to interpret the painting.</p>

<p>still, painting is <em>mark by mark</em>, that is: digital</p>

<p><em>discontinuous correlation</em>: when symbols aren’t correlated in space or time (like it would be in an analog clock), but only in thought (like a digital clock which jumps from 11:59 to 12:00)</p>

<p>after the computational explosion, analog and digital aren’t so different anymore: the analog and digital modes are now wholly continuous (in an artistic “co-mingling” (Ludwig Seyfarth))</p>

<p>the difference now lies in the intent of the creator: what she’s taken to be dense and replete (or not) in the inscriptions of her preferred media</p>

<p>it used to be that the analog would constitute the artistic analogy, but now it is the digital</p>
