<hr />

<p>winograd is one of the founders of the HCI lab at stanford and has worked on trying to make language understood to computers.</p>

<hr />

<p>approach through <em>design</em> (the interaction between creating and understanding), and mostly about developing a theory of language</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the computer is a device for creating, manipulating and transmitting symbolic (i.e. linguistic) objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“every questioning grows out of a tradition” -&gt; what is the tradition of this thesis? (also, meaning is relative to what is understood through the tradition)</p>

<h4 id="chapter-5---language-listening-and-commitment-pp56-64">chapter 5 - language, listening and commitment (pp.56-64)</h4>

<p>combination of hermeneutics with speech act theory (meaningful acts in situations of shared activity)</p>

<p>mathematical language is, by definition, <em>context-free</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meaning is created by an active reading, in which the linguistic form triggers interpretation, rather than conveying information.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That which is not obvious is made manifest through language</p>
</blockquote>

<p>austin has *five fundamental illocutionary points**:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assertive: says whether that is the case or not</li>
  <li>directive: attempt to get the hearer to do sth (questions/commands)</li>
  <li>commissive: commit the speaker to some future action</li>
  <li>expressive: express a psychological state about X (apologizing, praising, forgiving)</li>
  <li>declarative: brings about the correspondence between the propositional content of the speech act and reality</li>
</ul>

<p>(each of these points can have different forms)</p>

<p>theoretical language (rational) vs. practical (situated)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Language and cognition are fundamentally social (p.61).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>structural coupling (skills) with a consensual domain (piece of source code) is how an autopoeitic structure emerges (self-sustained attention? aesthetic experience?)</p>

<p>there are <strong>three basic kinds of grounding</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>experiential (an observation to verify)</li>
  <li>formal (a logical language-game to verify)</li>
  <li>social (relying on what others said to verify)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="chapter-6---towards-a-new-orientation-pp70-80">chapter 6 - towards a new orientation (pp.70-80)</h4>

<p>summarization of concerns</p>

<ul>
  <li>cognition as embeded/<em>dasein</em> (structural coupling)</li>
  <li><strong>cognition viewed not as activity in some mental realm, but as a pattern of behaviour that is relevant to the functioning to the person or organism in its world</strong></li>
  <li>disagrees with “knowledge is a storehouse of representations, which can be called upon for use in reasoning and which can be translated into language” -&gt; the problem is that “things” do not have independent properties. heidegger: “things” emerge when they breakdown, when they become a matter of concern, when they become distinct (already skill?).</li>
  <li>corresponding representation hypothesis: the assumption that cognition rests on the manipulation of symbolic representations that can be understood as referring to objects and properties in the world.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence of computation lies in the correspondence between the manipulation of formal tokens and the attributions of a meaning to those tokens as representing elements in worlds of some kind. (p.74)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>pre-understanding and background are important for meaning-making (fluency). knowledge is <em>always</em> the result of interpretation, which in turn depends on the entire previous experience of the interpreter and on situadness in a tradition.</p>

<p>their approach to language is not that language is transmission of information, but rather that is a form of human social action, with mutual orientation (but i don’t see those as mutually exclusive)</p>

<h4 id="chapter-7---computers-and-representation">chapter 7 - computers and representation</h4>

<p>focusing on the fundamental issues of language and rationality that are the background for designing and programming computers.</p>

<h5 id="programming-as-representation">7.1 -  programming as representation</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first and most obvious point is that whenever someone writes a program, it is a program about something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(called the subject domain; interesting how it switched to being called problem-domain in software engineering)</p>

<p>the programmer has a systematic correspondence between the symbols contained in storage cells and how they represent objects and relationships in the subject domain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Success in programming depends on designing a representation and set of operations that are both <em>veridical</em> [produce results that are correct] and <em>effective</em> [they are usable].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>most important parts of a formal system (e.g. a programming language):</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a structure of formal symbols which can be manipulated according to precisely-defined and well-understood rules.</li>
  <li>there is a mapping through which the relevant properties of the domain can be represented by symbol structures</li>
  <li>there are operations that manipulate the symbols in such a way as to produce veridical results (derive new structures, which are still veridical)</li>
</ul>

<p>the problem is that representation is in the mind of the beholder: in no way do programming languages depend on the fact that they represent something (at least, sth too concrete; because they do have pointers, registers, etc., which represent something tangible).</p>

<p>cf. Newell &amp; Simon, 1976, “Computer Science as Empirical Enquiry” -&gt; for the ability of computers to refer to themselves</p>

<p>computers have <strong>levels of abstraction</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>physical machine (components and copper)</li>
  <li>logical machine (boole, circuits, gates)</li>
  <li>abstract machine (assembly, pointers, instruction sets)</li>
  <li>higher-level languages (cobol, fortran, lisp) - this requires compilers or interpreters</li>
  <li>a representation scheme for “facts” (which we would call data today), like linked open data, relational, etc.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>the subject domain is always the next higher level itself (p. 89)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>some issues, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breakdown (some levels might not operate as anticipated)</li>
  <li>resource use (some things described are only relevant at a lower level) -&gt; depends on the <strong>implementation</strong> (about process more than result)</li>
  <li>accidental representation: mismatch between machine realization and programmer intention (e.g. glitch, hacks) -&gt; one could say that some structures of the machine do not represent the results it outputs (like hacking a display to render a heart on a TI calculator)</li>
</ul>
