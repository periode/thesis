<p>add this to examples, from the rust parser example i forked, as an example of how people assign quality to proper scale naming:</p>

<p><code>rust
// Level-change Operator (what a stupid name)
operator_level = { operator_exp | operator_subscript |
                   operator_exp ~ operator_subscript |
                   operator_subscript ~ operator_exp
}
</code></p>

<p>Brenda Baker undertook her Fortan-to-Ratfor converter against the advice of her department head–me. I thought it would likely produce an ad hoc reordering of the orginal, freed of statement numbers, but otherwise no more readable than a properly indented Fortran program. Brenda proved me wrong. She discovered that every Fortran program has a canonically structured form. Programmers preferred the canonicalized form to what they had originally written.

<ul>
  <li>for each of the aesthetic domains (lit, arch, eng, math), add source code examples to show what is similar, and what is different in source code vs. original domains -&gt; <strong>INTERTWINE!</strong></li>
  <li>my approach to metaphors should be more systematic: that is, I should look into how metaphors can represent a SYSTEM (for instance, <code>symlink</code> is a limitation when it comes to the files and folder metaphor)
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. how does step in a debugger relate to code as terrain, or surface coverage for tests? e.g. how does build and architecture related to code as structure?</li>
      <li>ask “why does the metaphor work?” -&gt; how do they (a) combine (b) extend (c) question?</li>
      <li>look at all the metaphors that fit together (in the lit domain, the arch domain, etc.)</li>
      <li>metaphor of the <code>macro</code> (implies scale), of <code>scope</code>, of <code>global</code>, implies scale as well. <code>libraries</code> is also a metaphor that is literary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fictionality: creates a model of the world. while i make the distinction between fiction and non-fiction, i should focus on why it is fiction that acts as a simulation (i.e. jerome pelletier, nelson goodman, marie laure ryan “textual actual worlds”) -&gt; essentially show that fiction might be as relevant as non-fiction in source code</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>case studies</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>choose the case-studies in the way that is the most illustrative of my point. doesn’t have to be huge.</li>
      <li>i should definitely have a more comparative approach: multiple code-bases, with aesthetics which are tied to <strong>LANGUAGE</strong>, <strong>COMMUNITY</strong> and <strong>PROBLEM</strong> (question of the idiomatic). this is better than having one case study after another, completely discontinued.</li>
      <li>find similar problems in different programs, see how they deal with it</li>
      <li>find specific cases where the cognitive load is high</li>
      <li>again, <strong>DO IT IN PARALLEL</strong> as a comparative studies.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>[ ] make it clear that we’re focusing on two sorts of knowledge: formal, or contextual.</li>
  <li>[ ] in the hardware existence of software, talk about memory management</li>

  <li>[ ] at the end of the psychology section, mention the skills needed by a programmer (see below) and this will help us in the followig cognitive tools section to prove that tools indeed help with some of these.</li>
  <li>[ ] in terms of metaphors, make clear that programmer-facing metaphors are not more complex than user-facing metaphors, or that it’s a different kind of cognitive work, but rather that they are referring to a different kind of concept (streams, pipes, volatile memory, etc.)! For instance, mention how there are files/folders for users, and these are manipulated differently on GUI and CLI (CLI -&gt; bash script: “loops”, “labels”, “wildcards”). these show that the metaphors at work in programming are a combination of different concepts, drawing on different fields of knowledge.</li>

  <li>[ ] a sentence or two on a fundamental connection between architecture and programming, related to how architecture must connect form and function as other arts are not required to do</li>
  <li>[ ] If you want to exhibit the difference between a (reasonably) high-level language, assembly, and machine code, you could contrive an example yourself by writing something very short in C and compiling it in gcc. The GNU Assembler, as, is what is used as part of the gcc toolchain, so if you were to write the corresponding assembly and confirm that it assembles to the same machine code … you have your example. And you might do it in a half-page of C, a similar amount of assembly, and 32 bytes of machine code.</li>
  <li>[ ] make a <strong>clear</strong> distinction between <code>source code</code> (the medium) and <code>program text</code> (the instance)</li>
  <li>[ ] refine our definition of aesthetics by adding the fact that <code>it enables an  evaluative appraisal of objects</code></li>
  <li>[ ] add this section to the introduction, making sure i frame aesthetic vs. beautiful vs. artistic</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is also a broad definition of what aesthetic is, and is different from beautiful, which also elicits an emotional response, or gut feeling, and can be implied in definitions of what is artistic. so i don’t talk about beauty, but about code which exhbitis positive aesthetic properties—finding beautiful code in an art history sense has not been achieved.</p>
