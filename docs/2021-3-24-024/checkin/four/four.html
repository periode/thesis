<p>The immediate next aspect that I will be focusing on is therefore to highlight the aesthetic criteria which support two other communities of practice: <strong>hackers</strong> and <strong>artists</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-overarching-point">the overarching point</h2>

<p>aesthetics matter, even in such a highly formal, syntactical, autotelic system as a computer. they connect a surface-structure with a deep structure.</p>

<p>how does it contribute to the world? by showing that there is no separate domain of aesthetics, but also that they’re not essential, but a mark of high-quality and, again <em>that they allow us to understand</em>.</p>

<h2 id="main-points">0 - main points</h2>

<p>first i want to touch upon cursory work in source code poetry (paloque berges), and connect that to metaphor and literary tradition. then i want to talk about hacking (demoscene, folies, one-liners), and then connect that lack of aesthetic concern (qualify! different kinds of aesthetics) to the question of “what is there to understand” and therefore the question of <strong>semantics</strong>. i will close by exploring the different concepts in programming that are hard to communicate.</p>

<p><strong>CONCEPTS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>semantic compression</li>
  <li>spatio-visual problem solving</li>
  <li>concepts to communicate? the stream? the map?</li>
</ul>

<p>this is not so much about code aligning with standards of literature, but maybe aligning to the standards of both epistemology and architecture, <em>architectural knowledge</em>, and how literature could also align with these.</p>

<p>the MIT study on reading code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emphasis placed on the symbolic, cognitive, planning aspects of the arts leads us to give value to the role played by problem-solving, seeing there a model in terms of which the moment-to-moment artist’s behavior at work can be described. “An analysis of behavior as a sequence of problem- solving and planning activities seems to be most promising […]” (goodman)</p>
