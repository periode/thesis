<hr />

<p>an analysis of how alexander pursued beauty through complexity</p>

<hr />

<p>Beauty is involved in moving from <em>disorganized complexity</em> towards <em>organized complexity</em>. This goes beyond simply code or architecture, but encompass a lot more systems. His goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to make sense of complexity</li>
  <li>how to make beauty</li>
  <li>how to overcome cognitive limitations</li>
  <li>how to find the proper mathematical expression</li>
</ul>

<p>Alexander’s successive conceptions of beauty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appropriateness</li>
  <li>rightness to fit</li>
  <li>not simple</li>
  <li>wholeness (which comes before)</li>
</ul>

<p>“deep interlock and ambiguity create beauty”, which seems to be in this case something very different from what has been found so far in programming; it’s more about clarity and simplicity. However, this can perhaps arise from complexity?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“something with the quality is so strong, so balanced, so clearly self-maintaining that it reaches into the realm of eternal truth, even if it lasts for only an instant”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the Quality Without A Name.</p>

<p>Well, the first and biggest difference is that architects deal with the animate and unexpected (people) and computer scientists deal with the inanimate and expected (computers -but actually the unexpected because of streams, memory management and uncertainty of pointer arithmetic), so that restricts the extent to which his criteria for beauty could be applied.</p>

<p>Still, his desire to look for <em>what <strong>makes</strong> the beautiful</em>, instead of <em>what <strong>is</strong> the beautiful</em>, is an interesting approach. And indeed, in the first part of this research, on the aesthetics of software developers, I’ve essentially found patterns.</p>

<p>He also wants a tight relationship between fact and value, between what is and what ought to be, between the situation and the goal.</p>

<p>Epistemology and knowledge are always driven by personal experience, by things that have been noticed. What are the things that I personally have been noticing? That there are pieces of code where someone feels <em>at ease</em>, is comfortable with experimenting, changing, expressing oneself.</p>

<p>There’s also a huge part about symmetries and sub-symmetries, which seem to manifest Alexander’s background in maths and his desire for verifiability. He then discovers the <em>“paradoxical interplay between symmetry and asymmetry”</em> (between simplicty and complexity). Symmetry is the desired state, and asymmetry is the required state, as a manifestation of function not bowing down to form, and therefore shaping form itself.</p>

<p>Is there a <em>center</em> to source code? Does it have geometric properties? Does it <em>fold</em>? Obviously yes, functions are patterns in themselves. Additionally, he mentions that centers have centers in a <strong>recursive</strong> manner.</p>

<p>Some of Alexander’s geometric properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>boundaries</li>
  <li>deep interlock</li>
  <li>ambiguity</li>
  <li>contrast</li>
  <li>gradient</li>
  <li>roughness</li>
  <li>echoes</li>
  <li>void</li>
  <li>not-separateness (how is that related to interlocking?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are some things that are definitely interesting, but do not 1:1 map to software: for instance, the quality of <em>roughness</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Simplicity is not the geometrically banal.</strong></p>

<p>Then Gabriel’s addition is the focus on <em>evocative power</em>, on the possibility of signifying something else.</p>
