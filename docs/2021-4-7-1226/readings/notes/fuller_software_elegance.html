<p>knuth:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leanness of code</li>
  <li>clarity with which the <em>problem</em> is defined</li>
  <li>spareness of use of resources</li>
  <li>implementation in the most suitable language in the most suitable system</li>
</ul>

<p>-&gt; this definition of elegance is between the machine and programmer</p>

<p>use of materials should be the barest and cleverest -&gt; too much emphasis on one criteria leads to clunkiness/overcomplication</p>

<p>Gregory Chaitin’s formulation of  program- size defi nition of complexity: A measure of the complexity of an an-swer to a question is the size of the smallest program required to compute it. The resulting drive to terse programs produces a defi nition of elegance being found in a program “with the property that no program written in the same programming language that produces the same output is smaller than it is.” -&gt; but also some programs gets way too complicated, and so the elegant solution seems further and further away at each step</p>

<p>if elegance cannot be math formula, then, then it relies on skill</p>

<p>Finding a way of aligning one’s capacities and powers in a way that arcs through the interlocking sets of constraints and criteria, the material qualities of software, and the context in which it is forged and exists is key to elegance. -&gt; IT’S ABOUT BALANCE, OPTIMIZED(?)</p>

<p>is fast inverse square root elegant?</p>
