  <li>what is the distinction between <strong>creative</strong> and <strong>aesthetic</strong> writing of source code?</li>
  <li>decide between <strong>writing</strong> and <strong>reading</strong>? <strong>usage</strong> and <strong>possibilities</strong>?</li>
  <li>what definition of <strong>code</strong> do i want to choose?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>the aesthetics of clarity in executable source code</p>

<p>“experientialism” / experiential realism</p>

<p>questions of clarity vs. simplicity (how often do they correspond? oppose?) - is one within time, or within space, or within people?</p>

<p>semantics? -&gt; programming languages have semantics (either denotational or operational, stratchey) -&gt; operational is whatever the machine says, and we can realize/describe/use a sympbol without understanding it</p>

<p>understanding the symbol vs. understanding what the symbol refers to</p>

<p>there is always a bit of giving up the understanding (linux kernel, APIs, etc.). does it remove the essence or in contrary highlight it?</p>

<p>the role of case studies: develop an outline from looking at code, then confront that outline (which will probably be multifaceted) with case studies (2-3)</p>

<p>what do programmers have been implicitly saying in their discourses about code?</p>

<p>what is the difference between poetics and aesthetics? poetics put together an effect (formal, subjective) vs. aesthetics are more universal, inherent, contemplative?</p>

<p>draft a couple of paragraphs on machine understanding ++ the difference between poetics and aesthetics</p>

    <ul>
      <li>if compilation make the source code poem lose its specificity, how does that help us define what that specificity is?</li>

    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>double-meaning (paloque) is the fact that one can play between machine-language and human-language</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>possible triple-meaning with an interplay in conceptual structures (OOP)</li>
    </ul>

      <li>but also the fact that the domain of application of software can always expand can always expand (from a computational perspective)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>there is also the idea that, even when the code might not work properly, or might barely work (in a functional perspective), it might <em>still</em> work in a literary perspective, the same way that flaubert works, or that beckett works, i.e. <strong>does what is intended of it to do</strong> (how do we know that? we need critical tools to assess the “aestheticity”)</li>

  <li>
    <p>expressing vs. explaining (Kurosawa)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>programming languages as actors in actor network theory?</p>
  </li>
  <li>programming languages define sets of aesthetic relationships, and as such are <em>resources for intellectual/thoughtful work/formulation</em></li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>this is kinda what los pequenos glazier was saying when he was asking “how does materiality influence the text itself?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>on a less formal level, the sociohistorical approach to literature implies that literature judges a society, and a society can explain its literature.</li>

  <li>there is the reader, and there is the act of reading. does it need to be out loud? how are things pronounced?</li>
  <li>who is the subject, in a code-text?</li>
  <li>what are the tensions between lit and code?</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>lit can create any word (joyce), code cannot (really? cf. <em>growing a language</em>) –but that is changing with OOP?</li>

  <li>
    <p>the opposite of an aesthetic of the frustration (in which the reader can not know everything) is an aesthetic of the XXX (sublime? demiurgic?), in which the reader is presented with everything, computationally, but still always reduced to the words used and read</p>
  </li>
  <li>*In linguistics, prosody is concerned with those elements of speech that are not individual phonetic segments (vowels and consonants) but are properties of syllables and larger units of speech, including linguistic functions such as intonation, tone, stress, and rhythm. Such elements are known as suprasegmentals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prosody may reflect various features of the speaker or the utterance: the emotional state of the speaker; the form of the utterance (statement, question, or command); the presence of irony or sarcasm; emphasis, contrast, and focus. It may otherwise reflect other elements of language that may not be encoded by grammar or by choice of vocabulary.* (wiki)</p>

<p><em>acknowledgment of socio-cultural context within which code poetry emerges, then formal examination of language through which these are written, and circling back towards what these formal uses have to contribute about the purpose/meaning of writing source code poetry (communities, hackers, exploitative economic systems, etc.), and allow for a new perspective on contemporary literature.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>recap of existing work on why code is an object of study</li>
  <li>extending that range of study (what has been explored so far are <em>themes</em>, <em>distribution</em>, <em>communities</em> (at least CPB, Bouchardon)):</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(1)</strong> stylistically, at the micro-level (style), (developing theoretical tools, frames of analysis, close readings, new reading postures -e.g. readers as compilers and interpreters)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(2)</strong> empirically, at the macro-level (genre), (other domains, such as style guides, comments, new corpuses that have been released since the previous studies (source code poetry, etc.))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(3)</strong> linguistically (analysis and design of programming languages) (parts 1 and 2 will have to solidly argue as to why one should care about languages/materiality -classes and structs are the new materiality??)</li>
