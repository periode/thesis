<p>“In every civilization, the skilled artificer has an honored place beside the scribe and the shaman”</p>

<p>“[The students showed] the joy of a skilled craftsman in a job well done. Science gave them their chance to build things that opened new horizons, just as their ancestors built ships to explore new continents.”</p>

<p>“In spite of the rise of Microsoft and other giant producers, software remains in large part a craft industry. Because of the enormous variety of specialized applications, there will always be room for individuals to write software based on their unique knowledge.”</p>

<p>craft: being good at something,  enjoying it and caring about it</p>
