<blockquote>
  <p>This theory is a rhetoric, in that it teaches the mastery of contextual interplay by means of a knowledge of criteria of understanding other than those of simple univocity upon which logic is built. Such attention to criteria is a descendant of the ancient reflection on ‘virtues of lexis’; but those older criteria – precision, liveliness, expressiveness, clarity, beauty – remain locked in to the superstition concerning proper meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>shouldn’t these criteria still apply today?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we can say that the metaphor holds together within one simple meaning two different missing parts of different contexts of this meaning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the importance of the context, not just the one provided by the reader, but the one in which the words themselves are embedded (lexical field)</p>

<p>polarities (tensions):
- event / meaning
- sense / reference
- individual / universal</p>
