<p>galloway, protocols</p>

<p>code of the city: standards
- questions of origin and diffusion
  - how were design standards first generated and adopted?
  - did the industry become dependent on it (when?)? how are they disseminated, practiced, enforced?
- questions of performance and outcome
  - what forms of software have resulted form it? what are its deficiencies?
  - what impact did standards have on the industry (if any?)
  - how are standards viewed by those who administer them, and those who are administered by them?
- questions of transformation and opportunity
  - what are the implications of restructuring design standards?
  - what processes and tools can foster change?
  - can tech and software provide more flexible/open working environments?</p>

<p>style as managing ambivalent attachments to big social forms &gt; mcgurl, d.a. miller</p>

<p><em>tzvetan todorov</em>: “les effets de style ne pourraient exister que s’ils ne s’opposaient a une norme, a un usage etabli”</p>

<p>style negotiations in open source platform are a conflict between personal initiative and group direction, and in that mimicks the productive tensions in open-source software.</p>

<p>This study has implications for understanding…… <code>TO BE COMPLETED</code> (the limitations of do wtf you want lol)</p>

<p>What are the objectives?</p>

<p>This paper examines the discursive strategies at play when deciding on a programming style in the context of open-source development</p>

<p>which concepts do i rely on? (readerly/writerly texts is a good start)</p>

<p>what is the existing research on this topic? (keywords: style, written approach, organizational aesthetics)</p>
