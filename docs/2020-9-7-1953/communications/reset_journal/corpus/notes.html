<p>if having a style guide most commonly seen as something good, why is the process to get there so damn complicated?</p>

<p>three approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the style guides present themselves</li>
  <li>how people discuss them/fork them on github (issues, tagged as enhancement)</li>
  <li>how people comment them on other places on the web</li>
</ul>

<p>they use the word “opinionated” a lot. <strong>the interesting thing is that there are not objectively correct answers but questions of style, even though these questions are approached as if they are</strong> &gt; open-source as objectifying the subjective</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/faq/misc.html#bikeshed-painting">“it is about personal pride and prestige”</a></p>

<p>there might also be <em>radical difference</em> (style wars, tabs vs. space) as well as <em>incremental difference</em> (e.g. “making this change, in combination with AirBnB’s style guide…” etc.)</p>

<p>also issues of bugs! you need to hack the config when a bug makes it necessary (more actor-network theory) -&gt; to what extent is style used/linked/intricated with a tool?</p>

<h2 id="categories">categories</h2>

<ol>
  <li>personal pride, prestige and preference</li>
  <li>technical argument (negative: tool not supporting X, etc. <strong>or</strong> positive: <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier.html">prettier is the only fully automated style guide</a>)</li>
  <li>rationale argument</li>
</ol>

<p>categories 1. uses the pronoun “i”, first person singluar, the 3. uses “we”: hints at the relationship between organizations (while at the same time being for interoperability)</p>

<p>javascript doesn’t actually have a style guide
ruby has one
go has everything
python has a style guide as well</p>

<p>the core principle is “fully automatic”; on their website, they acknowledge that there are multiple reasons why one would want to use Prettier, and they list the different categories</p>

<p>one of the main devs is confused that there are so little forks, because the issue is a <code>technical argument</code> rather than a <code>personal one</code> <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/3101#issuecomment-606764384">src</a>. as it turns out, it’s actually a different kind of <code>technical</code>, because forking perttier involves forking other plugins/files which come with it (you can fork a project, and it’s more difficult to fork an ecosystem)</p>

<p>at the end of issue 3101, it just gets redirected to <a href="https://github.com/brodybits/prettierx">a fork</a>, and it is also the closing argumentation of <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/8507">this</a> (funny, cause this fork of prettier actually uses <strong>standardJS</strong> as some style inspiration)</p>

<p>“i disagree, can i change it?” answer is NO</p>

<p>the point is to save <strong>time</strong> and give an answer to unsolved (unsolvable?) debates. therefore, it is seen as “not an actual, real problem”.</p>

<p>the point of <em>standard</em> is that it is both an indicator of <em>standard of quality</em> and basis for a <em>style standard</em></p>

<p>justification from the founder: <a href="https://feross.org/never-use-semicolons/">link</a>, it is about technical, about “being kept safe”</p>

<p>the first comment is “sorry, this doesn’t make sense to me”</p>

<p>response in support of “no semi-colon”, user “Chipotle”
&gt; “the simplest approach is the one with fewer rules and characters”</p>

<p>response against, user “Heheh”
&gt; “The people are divided on those who are real programmer (they are use semicolons). And hobbysts who have never programmed in another language.”</p>

<p>it’s about productivity and maintainability</p>

<p>javascript has a lot of tools and everything else (and it’s typical of javascript)</p>

<p>aesthetics is the prime justification of the author: breathing some air, making it lighter, nicer
&gt; indentation is one of the rules that breathes more “air” into AirBnB’s default style guide. As a result, your code doesn’t crowd on the left side of editor so badly.</p>

<p>call to personal judgment
&gt; I encourage you to give them a try. I think you’ll quickly experience what a difference this makes.</p>
