<hr />

<p>the impact of writing on religion, economy and state</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="religion">religion</h4>

<p>writing actually prevents change from happening (change is much more fluid and easy in oral cultures)</p>

<p>oral systems of belief are open-ended in a meaningful way, encouraging search.</p>

<p>writing brings out the specialization of roles (through sole interpreter of the word)</p>

<p>increased autonomy</p>

<h4 id="economy">economy</h4>

<p>writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promotes new technologies</li>
  <li>extends the possibilities of (1) management and (2) commerce and production</li>
  <li>transforms methods of capital accumulation</li>
  <li>changes the nature of individual transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>writing is increased autonomy for the auto-didact, removes the need for context in source code (<em>“writing is not just communication, but also a means of distancing oneself form communication”</em>, p.50)</p>

<p>missing pp. 51-73</p>

<p>trade appeared in mesopotamia in part thanks to the <em>high standardization of documents</em></p>

<p>it’s not so much about writing as it is about automatic writing/formatting</p>

<h4 id="state-bureau-files">state, bureau, files</h4>

<p>again, “particularistic” (oral) vs. “universalistic” (written)</p>

<p>ability to distinguish “person” from “office” and therefore to ensure the continuity of an organization after the death of the head</p>

<p>“Again writing tends to make explicit what was implicit in oral communication”</p>
