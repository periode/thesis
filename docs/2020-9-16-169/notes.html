<p>there could be different beauties in writing and in reading (case of Mike’s APL) - easier to read vs. easier to type</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My personal style guide is to copy Erlang: double quotes for text, single quotes for programmatic strings (atoms/symbols). The single quote is slightly more convenient to type on a qwerty keyboard, but text regularly contains single quotes (apostrophes). It also provides a semantic visual shortcut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the concept of <strong>semantic visual shortcut</strong>, also <strong>semantic compression</strong> (developed <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">here</a>)</p>

<p>this could be an interesting theory about the reading process: [https://www.fabula.org/actualites/luigi-pareyson-esthetique-theorie-de-la-formativite_21236.php]</p>

<p>questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>categories of people are relevant? should i look into academic as well? i’m afraid there might not be so much information/sources</li>
  <li>the difference between syntactical and semantic metaphors?</li>
  <li>would you like to see the corpus? how should i display/save it?</li>
  <li>are metaphors contributing to the research project? should i stick to the functional part of aesthetics.</li>
</ul>

<p>the intent overall is to see to what extent there is an overlap between each</p>
