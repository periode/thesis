<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>it has long been said that the practical existence of humanity is absorbed in the struggle between individuality and generality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is the base statement</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the deeper and more unique the impression of a work of art is on us, the less the question of style tends to play a role in this impression</p>
</blockquote>

<p>style is actually what brings the individual into the many</p>

<p>example of goethe: from an individual genius to a general trait of his works, then adopted by others</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the limits of the originality of the individual</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the essence of the work of applied art is that it exists many times; its diffusion is the quantitative expression of its usefulness, for it always serves a need shared by many people.
[…]
we also observe […] how the objects of applied art are individually designed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but this separation (between some things unique and some things not) is also a symbolic separation</p>

<p>“the most repulsive conflict arises” from the chair doesn’t want to be just a chair</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where only one style is conceivable, every individual expression grows organically from it; it has no need to search first for its roots; the general and the personal go together without conflict in a work</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you cannot become a unity yourself, then join a unity as a serving partner […] which grants even the most modest achievement</p>
</blockquote>
