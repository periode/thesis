<p>“mixed coding style is harder to maintain than bad coding style” -&gt; this is what brings us to the automatic linters</p>

<h2 id="sometimes-style-really-does-matter-david-reed">sometimes style really does matter, david reed</h2>

<p>he explains that style is more than aesthetics, and helps understanding</p>

<p>there are uniquivocal rules (everyone agrees on) (e.g. naming conventions)</p>

<p>there are also competing, yet equivalent styles: no real answers, so the answer becomes “consistency” which is enforced by linters</p>

<h2 id="fractal-analysis-of-programming-style">fractal analysis of programming style</h2>

<p>Tools like <code>indent</code> are a staple of softeng: it’s not about what is beauty, but what is knowable about it, and thus enforceable</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aesthetic value is not the same as readability</p>

<p>this is from: Posnett, Daryl, Hindle, Abram &amp; Devanbu, Prem, (2011) “A Simpler Model of Software Readability”,</p>

  <p>Gabriel  argues against clarity and conceptual beauty as primary goals of software in favour of what the author calls “habitability.”</p>

<p>there is a large gap between knowing the rules and following them: so we need tools not just to detect, but also to take action</p>

<p>the guy argues that style should be built into the language grammar</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, you will never enforce any style globally unless people have literally no choice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the important part is that it comes <em>from the language</em>, therefore limitation on the power of community in the sense that the community should be able to crowd-decide what is best.</p>

<h2 id="perceived-language-complexity-in-github-issuediscussions-and-their-effect-on-issue-resolution">Perceived Language Complexity in GitHub IssueDiscussions and Their Effect on Issue Resolution</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rhetoric and technical language are on opposite endsof a language complexity spectrum: the former is stylisticallynatural; the latter is terse and concise. Issue discussions embodythis duality, as developers use rhetoric to describe technical issues.The style mix in any discussion can define group culture andaffect performance, e.g., issue resolution times may be longer ifdiscussion is imprecise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>findings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We find that experienced users conform to project-specific languagenorms, popular individuals use overall GitHub language ratherthan project-specific language, and conformance to project-specific language norms reduces issue resolution times</p>
</blockquote>

<p>technical language vs. community language (both subject to <em>perceived language complexity</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>project-specificterms and perceived language complexity exist, andsomeprojects have more project-specific perceived languagecomplexity than others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as for users,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they gravitate towards the project languagenormandpopular users (measured by the number of timesthey are @mentioned in issue discussions) are betterrepresented by the GitHub global language model thanproject-specific language models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a <strong>speech community</strong> describes a group of people who use language in a way that is mutually accepted among the group, which requires communitative competence (they must speak in a manner that is standard within the speech community—norm conformity) — less structured, end users</p>

<p>a <strong>community a practice</strong> (wenger &amp; lave) have shared practices, membership is internally constructed, co-construction of personal and group identities, with a shared social/instrumental goal. Kleinnijenhuis describes <strong>networks of practice</strong> — more structured, developers of project</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub discussions are a push-and-pull effort betweenthe push to use technical language that is relevant to theproject, and the pull to provide a narrative which frames one’sposition through rhetoric</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on these anecdotes, we hypothesize that a complexproject with project-specific code style requirements may bemore likely to useESLintorJSHint, while a smaller projectmay opt forstandardJSbecause it is easier to set up.While highly configurable tools likeESLintandJSHintrequire more effort in configuration, they may nullify disputesover code formatting and facilitate code review.standardJSrequires less initial effort from project maintainers and maybe appealing to new contributors who are familiar with thecommon code style. However, since its adoption likely entailedless configuration effort, maintainers may need to spend moretime on code review or address more issues about code styling.</p>

<h2 id="social-coding-in-github-transparency-and-collaboration-in-an-open-software-repository">Social Coding in GitHub: Transparency and Collaboration in an Open Software Repository</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We find  that  people  makea  surprisinglyrich  set  ofsocialinferences   from   the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someoneelse’s technical goals and vision when they edit  code, or  guessing which of several  similar  projects  has  the  best  chance  of  thriving  in the long term.</p>

<p>In the end, communication happens at the end of transparency: when the information isn’t readily available, when it is unclear. also signs of attentions.</p>

<p>there are <em>users</em> (regulars) and <em>commenters</em> (only post without opening issues or source code changes)</p>

<p>commenters are less polite than users, and more negative</p>

<p>commenters are also more aggressive (but only aggressive, actually; there is few variation in their emotion)</p>

<h2 id="lets-talk-about-it-evaluating-contributions-through-discussion-in-github-jason-tsay-laura-dabbish">Let’s Talk About It: Evaluating Contributions through Discussion in GitHub (jason tsay, laura dabbish)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We  found  that  developers raisedissues around contributions over  both  the  appropriateness of  the  problem  that thesubmitter  attemptedto  solve  and  the correctness   of   the   implemented   solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m only interested in the first part (appropriateness)</p>

<p>They also resort to external stakeholders: dependent projects or companies</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tsay et al. [23]found in a study of contributions in GitHub that a number  of  social  and  technical  factors influenced  the  probability of a contribution being accepted. When contributions were highly discussed,  contributions  were  much  less  likely  to  be  accepted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in the end it’s just a typology of discussions, not sure how useful</p>
