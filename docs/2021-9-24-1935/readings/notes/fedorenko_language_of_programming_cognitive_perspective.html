<p>it used to be that programming was always grouped with math and STEM, but there could be an alternative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key idea is this: when you learn a programming language, you acquire a symbolic system that can be used to creatively express yourself and communicate with others. The process of teaching programming can therefore be informed by pedagogies for developing linguistic fluency.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whereas the technical meanings of [syntax and semantics] in linguistics and CS differ, their usage highlights that both natural and programming languages rely on meaningful and structured representations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the process is the same. in the comprehension, you start by units and you build a big picture. in generation, you start with big picture and end with unit</p>

<p>it has also been shown that using unintuitive identifiers makes it hard to comprehend, thus still linking to language (at least on a <em>surface</em> level)</p>

<p>similarities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ML people use NLP techniques on code</li>
  <li>had been shown that knowing programming helps in acquisition of reading ability</li>
  <li>kidsâ€™ sequencing abilities improve dramatically after receiving coding intervention (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40692-019-00147-3">related study</a>)</li>
