<hr />

<p>talks of “the aesthetic” as a concept, whether is contingent on others, or irreducible</p>

<hr />

<p>All the definitions they give require the explanation of “aesthetic value” or “aesthetic jugment”. I focus on aesthetic value.</p>

<p>Difference between aesthetic and art (code poetry might be art, but it might not be aesthetic)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purely sensory?
    <ul>
      <li>In its form?</li>
      <li>In the relationship of its parts?</li>
      <li>In its intention?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A work of art has a character and a content, including formal (balance and unity), aesthetic (gracefulness, garrishness), expressive (melancholy, cheerfulness), representational (a woman, a data structure), semantic (meaning, metaphor), and symbolic (death, life, disintegration)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An item’s aesthetic value is the capacity to elicit “reasonable” or “apt” pleasurable admiration (pleasure not just from its perception), taken from its higher-order properties or relation between elements (aesthetic value).</p>

<p>But we can exchange pleasure with <strong>imaginative realization</strong>, and as such we get closer to cognition.</p>
