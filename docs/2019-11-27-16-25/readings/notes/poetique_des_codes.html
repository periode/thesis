<ul>
  <li>computers no longer with the expression of idea, but with their constitution (katherine hayles, talking about <em>incorporated cultural metaphors</em> in My Mother Was A Computer)</li>
  <li>a crossing of literary theory (jakobson) and information theory (shannon)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>JAKOBSON</strong>: if literature is made of interconnected structures, the “most literary” is the least familiar, the <em>innovative</em> engine which renews the system, relocates the expectations and repeats in a system of probabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>programming languages are composed of symbols rather than signs (in the semiotic sense)</li>
  <li>code is not only a tool of language, it also manipulates and restricts environments (and possibly linguistic environments, the brain)</li>
  <li>
    <p>code can be <strong>(1)</strong> executed and <strong>(2)</strong> writeable (in the Barthes-ian sense of the term, <em>texte scriptible</em>, which is then linked to a subjective appropriation of the code-object -making one’s own through writing/completing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>robert pinsky: poetry is a tool, and an individual tool, a tool which is limited to a small group of people (if not one person at a time), and is therefore very necessary in an age where the computer accelerates the advent of mass media). poetry would be critical access to media</p>
  </li>
  <li>studying code is bringing it back to the social structures in which it lives, from which it emerges (saussure)</li>
  <li>
    <p>georges mounin: the biggest difference between language and code is that the structures of language are implicit, bottom-up, and the structures of code or explicit, top-down</p>
  </li>
  <li>the real hermeneutical question is: what <strong>SHOULD</strong> the code do? both in effect and in affect</li>
  <li>
    <p>jerome mcgann: code as material symbol of social and ideological conditions of the production of texts (what are these conditions? network, messages, data)</p>
  </li>
  <li>history of oulipo (le lionnais) + calvino (la machine litterature)</li>
  <li>
    <p>lyotard oversees an exhibition on <em>les immateriaux</em> at pompidou (1985), including the <strong>uncertainty principle</strong> in literature, coming from information theory, and emphasis on a <em>“material which disappears as an independant entity”</em> and a material <em>“in which the language model supersedes the matter (matiere)”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>generative lit exists in the temporary, in the ephemeral, the instant, the interactive, while classical lit exists in the intangible, in the universal. <strong>TEMPORALITY OF CODE</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the virtuality of the text, the potential (oulipo again, heh), the <em>principles of creation</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>“les arts d’avant-garde procedent a des actions artistiques qui sont des gestes conceptuels d’intervention et d’action contre les discours sans fin des critiques”</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TYPOLOGIE OF PROGRAM STRUCTURE</strong> -&gt; structuralist, rhizomatic, modular, MVC, etc. there are plenty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each writer should be aware that they are writing in a tradition of ideas and practices (hartman, but bacon said the same), and therefore should distinguish itself from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aesthetics cannot disentangle themselves from the new and the surprising</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how does the use of a computer help us <em>identify the process of writing</em>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TEMPLATE</strong> &amp;&amp; <strong>DATA</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>digital poetry and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E is putting forth the relevance of <em>“position, location and structure”</em>, and how these can have generative (aka poietic) effects and outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>language is a <em>“structure of differences”</em> (+social context), since they (words) are all relational, and so writing code is playing with the codes of language (la langue), within the system of language (langages): functionally (generates <em>la langue</em>), and structurally (recomposes <em>le langage</em>): language is defamiliarized, and therefore becomes aesthetic (according to jakobson’s innovation thesis, supra). but you also need some sort of familiarity <em>a priori</em> to play with those words</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BOOTZ</strong> double text: technical and semiotic, which coexist within symbols in code (<em>respectivement, texte-auteur, tel qu’il est, et texte-a-voir, tel qu’il est imaginable, comprehensible, interpretable, potentiel</em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>the figure of the <em>cyborg</em> author, as described by Aarseth, is not valid because it doesn’t matter, in practice, what the code does, but it suffices to know that it does.</li>
</ul>

<p>stopped at p.42 cause the library closed :(</p>
