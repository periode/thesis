<p>Kuckuck. Notizen zur Alltagskultur 1/21: “Code”</p>

<p>In the age of ubiquitous digital computer technologies and human-machine collaborations, code is experiencing a revival in various contexts: source codes, binary codes and algorithms; software, encryption technologies and cryptography; numerical codes, formulas and functions; (geo)mapping, biometrics or computational genomics.</p>

<p>Codes are attributions, representations and entanglements of information and meaning. They are relations and dependencies which they simultaneously co-produce. However, codes also enable practices of appropriation, counterdiscourse and reinterpretation or even become an end-in-itself in code art.</p>

<p>The 1/2021 issue of the magazine “kuckuck. Notizen zur Alltagskultur” focuses on code in its multiple forms, on its engineering and (de-)ciphering.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to abstracts and ideas for scientific/essayistic or artistic contributions until August 15th, 2020.
Please send your Abstract to: L.Veprek@ekwee.uni-muenchen.de</p>

<p>The deadline for finished papers and contributions is January 30th, 2021.</p>

<h1 id="thoughts">thoughts</h1>

<p>code as the new craftsmanship (tying it with cultural histories)</p>

<p>also the fact that software developmen kinda grew organically, as infrastructure needs appeared, more hands than brain</p>

<p>how is it similar?
- style
- useful artform
- at some point, economic structure which enabled it
- pleasure</p>

<p>how is it different?
- mentorship (diffusion/acquisition of knowledge)
- relationship with tools (communal rather than personal)
- - therefore uncertainty as to what it does? (skilled labor vs. unskilled labor? is that a valid parallalel/distinction?)</p>

<p>why is it important/interesting?
- appreciate code as a practice, with the learning models appropriate
- alternative to monopolies with highly-skilled workers distributing information for less highly-skilled workers? (bootcamp vs. workshop? leaning online was the online workshop? but there is also the fact that only a few maintainers contribute actively on a project)</p>
