# contexts

in which writing/reading code happens, which therefore changes aesthetics

- professional -> software engineer
- hacker -> effective, personal beauty of understanding, and subverting systems
- scientist -> formal beauty of computation (and how it transpires sometimes in code itself)
- student/amateur -> beauty without extensive skill
- artist -> beautiful as poetic reference to the problem domain
