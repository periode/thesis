# 2021.01.11 - Reset Comment Review

## introduction and structure

I moved the first two paragraphs, as well as the last one of the *Three repositories* section up the introduction, right after the research question, and left the paragraph, dealing with the read/write aspect of GitHub as a complement to the section *The GitHub Development Platform*

I also moved the methodology section up the introduction, and rewrote some opening and closing sentences in order to avoid repetitions and make the new transitions clearer.

## additional verbatims

I added additional verbatims to better illustrate the analysis of the discussions:
- on p.11 added a verbatim illustrating the decision-making process of early issues
- on p.12, added a screenshot of ljharb explaining the rule and adding the "question" label (rather than "bug")
- on p.15, added a verbatim of a "religious issue"
- on p.16, added a verbatim about the argumented construction of a proposal of a stylistic change by KevinGrandon
- on p.20, added a verbatim showing the type of subjective, negative responses deployed as a response to rational argumentation
- on p.22, added a verbatim illustrating the no-options philosophy of prettier and their resort to read-only texts
- on p.25, added a verbatim illustrating the summarizing strategies of the project maintainers to guide the discusssion
- on p.26, added a verbatim illustrating the closing-off of public discussions of prettier core developpers
