- questions of origin and diffusion
  - how were design standards first generated and adopted?
  - did the industry become dependent on it (when?)? how are they disseminated, practiced, enforced?
- questions of performance and outcome
  - what forms of software have resulted form it? what are its deficiencies?
  - what impact did standards have on the industry (if any?)
  - how are standards viewed by those who administer them, and those who are administered by them?
- questions of transformation and opportunity
  - what are the implications of restructuring design standards?
  - what processes and tools can foster change?
  - can tech and software provide more flexible/open working environments?
