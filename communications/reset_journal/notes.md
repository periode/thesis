galloway, protocols

code of the city: standards
- questions of origin and diffusion
  - how were design standards first generated and adopted?
  - did the industry become dependent on it (when?)? how are they disseminated, practiced, enforced?
- questions of performance and outcome
  - what forms of software have resulted form it? what are its deficiencies?
  - what impact did standards have on the industry (if any?)
  - how are standards viewed by those who administer them, and those who are administered by them?
- questions of transformation and opportunity
  - what are the implications of restructuring design standards?
  - what processes and tools can foster change?
  - can tech and software provide more flexible/open working environments?

style as managing ambivalent attachments to big social forms > mcgurl, d.a. miller

*tzvetan todorov*: "les effets de style ne pourraient exister que s'ils ne s'opposaient a une norme, a un usage etabli"

style negotiations in open source platform are a conflict between personal initiative and group direction, and in that mimicks the productive tensions in open-source software.

This study has implications for understanding...... `TO BE COMPLETED` (the limitations of do wtf you want lol)

What are the objectives?

This paper examines the discursive strategies at play when deciding on a programming style in the context of open-source development

which concepts do i rely on? (readerly/writerly texts is a good start)

what is the existing research on this topic? (keywords: style, written approach, organizational aesthetics)
