> it has long been said that the practical existence of humanity is absorbed in the struggle between individuality and generality

this is the base statement

> the deeper and more unique the impression of a work of art is on us, the less the question of style tends to play a role in this impression

style is actually what brings the individual into the many

example of goethe: from an individual genius to a general trait of his works, then adopted by others

> the limits of the originality of the individual

> the essence of the work of applied art is that it exists many times; its diffusion is the quantitative expression of its usefulness, for it always serves a need shared by many people.
> [...]
> we also observe [...] how the objects of applied art are individually designed

but this separation (between some things unique and some things not) is also a symbolic separation

"the most repulsive conflict arises" from the chair doesn't want to be just a chair

> where only one style is conceivable, every individual expression grows organically from it; it has no need to search first for its roots; the general and the personal go together without conflict in a work

> if you cannot become a unity yourself, then join a unity as a serving partner [...] which grants even the most modest achievement
