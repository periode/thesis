> the quality of the code is not just in its execution, but also in its appearance

so it's not directly about collaboration, efficiency

> coding style is extremely personal, and everyone has their own preferred style

again, the text editor is *enforcing*

aspects of code style:

- How and when to use comments,
- Tabs or spaces for indentation (and how many spaces),
- Appropriate use of white space,
- Proper naming of variables and functions,
- Code grouping an organization,
- Patterns to be used,
- Patterns to be avoided.

> I liken the situation to a group of musicians trying to form a band. Each one comes in believing that their way of doing things is best (their “method” or “process”). The band will struggle so long as everyone is trying to do their own thing.

team communication!

makes errors obivous

and then at the end he states the tools


so:

- code style is essential
- it is personal
- it is automatically enforced

these three aspects open the question of how one (or many, actually) negotiate these? what kind of rationale/solutions do they offer?
