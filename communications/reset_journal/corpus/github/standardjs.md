the kind of repo that was started by one person, and is very much a open-source project in the midst of the javascript ecosystem

it seems like they are trying to develop a set of arguments in terms of:

- what eslint does
- the explanation of why decisions are taken (and further development in the documentation)
- the consistency and technical exhaustiveness of the package
- moving from readability as an important part to functionality (const, let, etc.) -- *semantics over stylistics*
- trying not to break the community's repos / not to break backwards compatibility

the argument against personal stylistics is that it avoids **bikeshedding**

## OPEN ISSUES

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1526] reference to ESLint as authority
[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1518] same
[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1507] relies on airbnb as a justification
- [https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1507#issuecomment-606198843] says no because it breaks the ecosystem (group justification)

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1490] here too the justification is only about technical implementation

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1464#issuecomment-567571091] the dude from airbnb shows up. it's interesting that he doesn't need to say much because he holds the authority, while the contributor is trying to make himself explicit, helpful and polite

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1459] reasonable approach and justification, accepted by mods
[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1437#issuecomment-544126236] questioning of the mods is a lot more explicit: "what is the right answer? blah blah"

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1402#issuecomment-528553639] in 2019, the community itself is an argument

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1402#issuecomment-529217486] lots of feelings from the moderator "I need to feel"..."I have felt enough"...

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1356] desire for no configuration == no issues? no discussions anymore? what does that mean? + open discussion with the community

ease of use: lack of technical friction prevents from thinking about the arbitrariness of some rules (on an aesthetic level)

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1352] case of a rule that is going to be removed  by community choice after it was added by community choice

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1352#issuecomment-446579168] explanation and pedagogy is king. **a user has an issue, another explains (rather than argues).**

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1321] these are supposed to be centralized questions about how to move forward, but people don't seem too interested... why?

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1183] they also control a fork? this is a user who wants to modify the rules, and is presented with `standardx`, another standard repo which allows original ruleset to be overriden. they just complain, and do not bring anything further

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1144#issuecomment-400830925] the community is again, the most important, as they run tests to see which way of doing (parenthesis in arrow functions) is most popular/common

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/932#issuecomment-310843073] has been convinced by a rational argument, asks that the rationale is then set in stone in the documentation (thus becoming more and more like airbnb)

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/932#issuecomment-388143669] this guy shows that, the more guides there are, the more they might tend to coalesce into one thing

> End of the day, it's a matter of personal preference and there can't be a clear winner here. So maybe being inline with other conventions is not a bad decision here.

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/927] this one is showing that the arguments are actually *practical examples of a failure*

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/796#issuecomment-291577650] exactly: the ecosystem first, then the personal preference, and the lack of a technical alternative

[https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/159#issuecomment-261969970] "i propose we don't break codebases" -> [https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/133] they said there was some "discussion" but it was mostly about the ecosystem
