## OPEN ISSUES

at the bottom of the README, there is:

> We encourage you to fork this guide and change the rules to fit your team’s style guide. Below, you may list some amendments to the style guide. This allows you to periodically update your style guide without having to deal with merge conflicts.

that means they are keenly aware that there are technical implications (as in, tools are there), and perhaps their success could be by acknowledging those and creating a sort of network/cooperation of the willing

i guess this is an example in which the discursive strategies on github are first and foremost established *by* the organization in such a way that prevents too much debate (commercial weight, acknowledgement of alternatives)

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/2208#issuecomment-613067919] "the guide is a mixture of instruction and guidelines, and that's OK" (as opposed to mostly guidelines for other guides) —the dude is also a member of the JS specification steering committee!

[this issue](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1875) is an example of having exeternal repos referecing: influence network [also](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1275)

again, very much about whether or not the linter rules would complain [src](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1812#issuecomment-389745443)

and about tools as solutions [src](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1640#issuecomment-533216474)

refers to the Airbnb **config** [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1640#issuecomment-533237903]

the discussion is more about technical implementation rather than about stylistic debates: [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1660] - it is mostly about asking `ljhard` about his opinion

assumption that ESLint and Airbnb are tightly coupled, so that if it's not in Airbnb it's not possible (i.e. guide is exhaustive) [src](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1660#issuecomment-419087604)

he's even fucking fixing code [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1311]

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/761#issuecomment-195756518] rational approach

kinda street-level bureaucracy, what `ljharb` is doing

other technical justification [src](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/761#issuecomment-350507083)

**what's up with not closing questions?**

seems the guide is based on experience rather than imposition: [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/216#issue-49306579]

> First of all, great job on this guide, I agree with it almost 100%. All of this should really be common knowledge, but I sure as hell didn't know most of these things when I started, so kudos for writing it all down.

the above dude is refering specifically to AirBnB (as the org)


which also makes sense: the guide itself is not up to debate, only its implementation

but then [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/216#issuecomment-448377793) he says that the guide is more important than the linter (#1 guide, which is solved for airbnb, #2 linter)

[polling all contributors](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089) -> by opening the issue, they control the narrative, and also ruling out aeshtetic preferences, which commenters follow    

reference to [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089#issuecomment-400710202] tc39, which `ljhard` works for

[this](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089#issuecomment-251294691):

> If avoiding it was an official stance, or if there was a real technical hurdle to using it, I would drop this. But I don't like the idea of just arbitrarily banning something without technical merit.

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089#issuecomment-259335955] personal preference doubled with invoking institutional authority

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089#issuecomment-265802675] acknowledges changing the airbnb codebase

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089#issuecomment-325798808] referring to a11y to settle a debate

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1089#issuecomment-510156670] "best practice" seems to be an overarching argument

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1408] nice didactic explanations, in which he concludes with "you're free to fork"

[https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/issues/527] following the town hall discussion, he concludes with "just override"

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/2251#issue-647972614] begging for clarification so that it can be added to their rules, even though the maintainer is saying explicitly that it doesn't matter

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1122] most commented issue (ish) is about technical clarity, and not debate //// going deep into functional vs. functional-like programming

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1365] most commented ish

- [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1365#issuecomment-350163209] he says that he refers explicitly to "airbnb does that"
- a lot of people (observers) disagree with the maintainer by way of emoji reactions
- [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1365#issuecomment-351476589] "the proper answer is to use a linter (...)" linter as a cosmogony -> the discussion shifts from the "why" to the "how"

- only 2 or 3 off-topic, heated comments
- [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1365#issuecomment-663973664] the ability of forking makes any argument actually moot

- [https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/263#issuecomment-410000143] in the end, it's not a community project, it's airbnb's project opened up to the community

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/851] this one is just office hours

[https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/1718#issuecomment-413965116] again, long discussion which ends up in tool-editing
