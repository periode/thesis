this post is by the dude from `create-react-app` and gets to the point of "the tragedy of the commons" (**TODO: figure out in what sense this is a tragedy? because everyone tries to chime in with their own opinion, to the detriment of the project?**)
[https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/40#issuecomment-271667966] -> refers to issues not as an issue tracker, but rather as a *desires* tracker
[https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/40#issuecomment-271672397] the community dilemma: "The downside is that leaving those options out could hinder adoption among people who feel strongly about the opposing choices and open the door for a fork."

the biggest problem in this issue is actually that it is *inconsistent*

the problem with large scale repositories is that, at some point, it becomes noise, in which everyone chips in with their particular preference and there is no clean way to keep track of the conversation
