# discursive strategies in style guide negotiations on github

## introduction

### incipit

- the tale of *the real programmer* who could speak with the machine
- - the tension between artistic skill and group coordination
- - the answer is a style guide to make everyone agree, but even that proves to be complicated

### definition of style

- simmel and artistic style
- - talks about how style has an inherent tension between individual and group
- - our focus on style as a group action (both ranci√®re & standardjs)

### the need for style in programming

- development of programming as a profession in the 1960s (djikstra)
- - moving from an obfuscated practice (women computers)
- - to an esoteric practice (the art of programming)
- - to a large group practice (GOTO, clean code, mythical man-month)

- the readerly and the writerly in barthes
- - the necessity to be able to write when you read (the assumption that, when you read, you will write)
- - opportunity to highlight a separation between barthes' conception of style (individual, meaningful, etc.) as opposed to the "langue": common, archaic

- finally, programming is hard as fuck
- - the need to understand mental structures is complicated enough that we invented high enough languages to deal with those problems

### the style guide as an object

- description of the style guide
- - reference document about both syntax, with references to a need for *readability* (skimming a text) and *clarity* (deep-diving a text)
- goody and literary organization of social life
- - develop on how the style guide embodies administrative work

### the ecosystem of programming

- github
- linters
- - linters as *objets intermediaires* (multiple facets)
- - the connection with actor network theory

question: what are some of the discursive strategies in place regarding style guide adoption and modification? how are these connected to, and affected by github?

hypothesis: the socio-technological milieu in which these discussions happen affects the argumentation

## research methods

- qualitative
- discourse analysis
- franekel

## locus of research

- on github
- - explain the difference between the three repo chosen
- - - same language
- - - different approaches (airbnb: internal dev + explanations, standard: external dev + multiple necessities, prettier: only style, uncertain document)
- outside github (additional texts)

## analytical categories

- emotional justification
- rational justification
- technical justification

- socio: founding texts
- socio: community/project
- technical: the functional

## findings

- objects are multifaceted and entangled/entangling
- personal preferences (means) can always be subsumed by calls to "efficiency" and "precedence" (reference to a canonical document)
- calls to "fork" are always the conclusion of an argument
- github issues can have multiple functions (pedagogical, antagonistic, reporting)

## conclusion

- sum up

in the end it's affected by github's:

- forum mechanism
- cross-reference across repos
- ability to fork
