question: to what extent did literary theory/fiction influence ai development?

- we have identified sources of scientific thought. what about fiction?

- it's possible that it didn't happen, which then means that there might not be a mutual influence of these fields (i.e. science -> fiction)

- the question then becomes: what is the nature of current developments, and how can we speculate it will change our perception/style/approach?
