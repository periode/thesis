# god's language: lisp and the fiction of AI

Contributors are invited to consider one or other of these topics:

## themes

- AI's fiction: robots, cyborgs, computers; **language** amongst the computer scientists
- the cultural history of representations of AI and its inventors (Alan Turing for example); leibniz et. al.

## notes

this contribution looks at how the early communities of AI development have built up a series of narratives around the power of language, and particularly logical language, and how assumptions about form and content allowed the development of modern computation and contemporary artificial intelligence.

### part on lisp itself, what it makes it special as a computer

list processing, abstracting away details, functions-as-data, eliza, tree-like structure

### the socio-historical context

leibniz, first AI dartmouth, SICP, lots of dialects

### what that tells us today

??? it's not so much language dependent as concept independent: the list, the group, which together form a pattern, from the line to the surface

## references that people in AI have

- mind/body problem
- the universal language (McCarthy, who made LISP)
