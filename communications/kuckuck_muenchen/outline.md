## introduction

why is this an interesting subject? provides one aspect of the life of programmers, more about their concrete occupation than about their depiction from outside

arts&craft movement have a profound distrust for the machine: that's a difference
but a belief in "free" craftsmanship, which could echo stallman

craftsmanship/handicraft as opposed to manufacture [the instinct of worksmanship](https://archive.org/details/instinctworkman00veblgoog/page/n252/mode/2up) + the place of the individual (but also not quite an opposition, a strange kind of contiuum)

also meritocracy! (same source as above, p.234)

> The logic of this technology, accordingly, is the logic of the ma- chine process, â€” a logic of masses, velocities, strains and thrusts, not of personal dexterity, tact, training, and routine. In the degree in which the information that comes to hand comes encumbered with a teleological bias, a connotation of personal bent, it is imavailable or refractory imder this logic

from early handicraft, personal, polyvalent, to late handicraft, specialized, technical

## 1 - professed similarities

this section inquires about the possible similarities on craftsmanship and software development, taking a historical look at both categories, and concluding a sub-category which might provide a link: building and architecture.

### a - overview of how software developers view their relationship to craftsmanship

- early days: hackers and myths
- compulsivity in practice: weizenbaum
- uncle bob: clean code

### b - parallel throughout history

a specific time: late middle ages/renaissance, before automation happened, after the times in which craftsmanship was disregarded socially

- middle-ages, builders, architects, guilds
- renaissance: optics, computers, tacit knowledge
- re-organization of work: artificiers

### c - commentaries today: architecture

- the cathedral and the bazaar
- patterns of software, patterns of space
- parallels with guilds and displacement of the hand-made (?)

## 2 - knowledge and value production

after having elucidated in what broad respects software development might be like craftsmanship, we highlight one specific aspect which asserts interesting tensions (both similarities and differences): knowledge acquisition and transmission

### a - knowledge in traditional craft

- short-circuit
- learning by doing and observing
- apprentices/masters
- cookbooks
- practice and repetition

### b - knowledge in software development

- ad hoc
- somewhat formalized, a lot self-taught
- learning by doing, not so much observing (paul graham, hackers and painters)
- - snippets of code on stack overflow?
- relationship to IP law? crafts and wares were signed, code as well. however, code can be hidden much more effectively.
- the bus factor
- the problem of documentation

### c - diffuse knowledge, hobbyists and amateurs

- a cheap tool
- diffuse knowledge, resulting maybe in more hobbyism than expertise (the network society, cscw studies)
- still specific commununity online

## 3 - aesthetics

at the heart of knowledge transmission and acquisition stands the *practice*, and inherent in the practice is the *good practice*, the beautiful one. this section investigates the aesthetics of code within the broader context of the aesthetics of craftsmanship, highlighting how code can act as a material.

### a - the aesthetics of craftsmanship

- pye
- sennett
- harold osborne

the question of style

### b - the aesthetics of code

- functional beauty (also in osborne: the difference between fine arts and craftsmanship is selflessness, practical utility)
- clear, simple, elegant
- no ornament?

### c - code as material

- essential complexity
- code smells, spaghetti, etc.
- the role of tools (terminal)

## conclusion

there are some self-proclaimed similarities, but the most reliable/salient ones come from architecture and aesthetics, making the case for code as material.
