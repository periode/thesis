Kuckuck. Notizen zur Alltagskultur 1/21: "Code"

In the age of ubiquitous digital computer technologies and human-machine collaborations, code is experiencing a revival in various contexts: source codes, binary codes and algorithms; software, encryption technologies and cryptography; numerical codes, formulas and functions; (geo)mapping, biometrics or computational genomics.

Codes are attributions, representations and entanglements of information and meaning. They are relations and dependencies which they simultaneously co-produce. However, codes also enable practices of appropriation, counterdiscourse and reinterpretation or even become an end-in-itself in code art.

The 1/2021 issue of the magazine "kuckuck. Notizen zur Alltagskultur" focuses on code in its multiple forms, on its engineering and (de-)ciphering.

We are looking forward to abstracts and ideas for scientific/essayistic or artistic contributions until August 15th, 2020.
Please send your Abstract to: L.Veprek@ekwee.uni-muenchen.de

The deadline for finished papers and contributions is January 30th, 2021.

# thoughts

code as the new craftsmanship (tying it with cultural histories)

also the fact that software developmen kinda grew organically, as infrastructure needs appeared, more hands than brain

how is it similar?
- style
- useful artform
- at some point, economic structure which enabled it
- pleasure

how is it different?
- mentorship (diffusion/acquisition of knowledge)
- relationship with tools (communal rather than personal)
- - therefore uncertainty as to what it does? (skilled labor vs. unskilled labor? is that a valid parallalel/distinction?)

why is it important/interesting?
- appreciate code as a practice, with the learning models appropriate
- alternative to monopolies with highly-skilled workers distributing information for less highly-skilled workers? (bootcamp vs. workshop? leaning online was the online workshop? but there is also the fact that only a few maintainers contribute actively on a project)
