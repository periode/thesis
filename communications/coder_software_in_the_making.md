# codes & coders: studying software in the making

Finally, coding is often the result of writing by more than one hand. When
achieved at a very large scale, as some successful free software projects
have, coding has been studied as a form of distributed cognition (Conein,
2004). What are the practical modalities and the material conditions that
enable the collective writing of software? The change of scale has been
enabled by technical innovations, such as the modularity of the UNIX
system, political movements and legal devices, like the Free Software
movement or the GPL licence, but also by infrastructures dedicated to
collaboration and sharing.

To get a better sense of the meaning
coders give to their practices could require exploring those professional
communities that are built around each language and its “philosophy”, as
well as the “good practices” that they promote and that vary significantly.
