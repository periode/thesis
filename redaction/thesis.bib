  abstract = {Antipatterns are "poor" solutions to recurring design problems which are conjectured in the literature to make object-oriented systems harder to maintain. However, little quantitative evidence exists to support this conjecture. We performed an empirical study to investigate whether the occurrence of antipatterns does indeed affect the understandability of systems by developers during comprehension and maintenance tasks. We designed and conducted three experiments, with 24 subjects each, to collect data on the performance of developers on basic tasks related to program comprehension and assessed the impact of two antipatterns and of their combinations: Blob and Spaghetti Code. We measured the developers' performance with: (1) the NASA task load index for their effort, (2) the time that they spent performing their tasks, and, (3) their percentages of correct answers. Collected data show that the occurrence of one antipattern does not significantly decrease developers' performance while the combination of two antipatterns impedes significantly developers. We conclude that developers can cope with one antipattern but that combinations of antipatterns should be avoided possibly through detection and refactorings.},

  abstract = {You can use this book to design a house for yourself with your family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office, or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction. After a ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure are now publishing a major statement in the form of three books which will, in their words, "lay the basis for an entirely new approach to architecture, building and planning, which will we hope replace existing ideas and practices entirely." The three books are The Timeless Way of Building, The Oregon Experiment, and this book, A Pattern Language. At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain "languages," which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. "Patterns," the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.},

Yet the power of present-day ideas is so great that many feel uncomfortable, even afraid, to say openly that they dislike what is happening, because they are afraid to seem foolish, afraid perhaps that they will be laughed at.Now, at last, there is a coherent theory which describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human society itself.The Timeless Way of Building is the introductory volume in the Center for Environmental Structure series, Christopher Alexander presents in it a new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always pulled the order of their world from their own being.Alexander writes, "There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. And as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills, and as our faces are."},

The Dialogic Imaginationpresents, in superb English translation, four selections fromVoprosy literatury i estetiki(Problems of literature and esthetics), published in Moscow in 1975. The volume also contains a lengthy introduction to Bakhtin and his thought and a glossary of terminology. Bakhtin uses the category "novel" in a highly idiosyncratic way, claiming for it vastly larger territory than has been traditionally accepted. For him, the novel is not so much a genre as it is a force, "novelness," which he discusses in "From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse." Two essays, "Epic and Novel" and "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," deal with literary history in Bakhtin's own unorthodox way. In the final essay, he discusses literature and language in general, which he sees as stratified, constantly changing systems of subgenres, dialects, and fragmented "languages" in battle with one another; Translation of: Voprosy literatury i \.estetiki; Includes index; Epic and novel -- From the Prehistory of novelistic discourse -- Forms of time and of the chronotope in the novel -- Discourse in the novel; Includes bibliographical references and index; Translation of: Voprosy literatury i estetiki},

  abstract = {Animal Crossing is an ``animal village simulator'' for the Nintendo GameCube and DS video game consoles.1 As the game begins, the player has just left home to move to the game's small village. There he meets a host of cartoonish animal residents and settles into a new life. The player is penniless upon arrival, and the game quickly thrusts him into the reality of making ends meet. The village's resident real estate tycoon and shopkeeper, Tom Nook, helps the player out, offering him a small shack to live in and a job of planting trees, delivering goods, and creating marketing materials on the town notice board (see figure 1). After completing these chores, Nook releases the player to explore the town on his own. He may then work, trade, and personalize his environment. The game offers a series of innocuous, even mundane activities like bug catching, gardening, and wallpaper designing. One of the more challenging projects in the game is paying off the mortgage on one's house. Animal Crossing allows players to upgrade their homes, but doing so requires paying off a large note the player must take out to start the game in the first place. The player must then pay down renovation mortgages for even larger sums.2 While the game omits some of the more punitive intricacies of long-term debt, such as compounding interest, improving one's home does require consistent work in the game world. Catching fish, hunting for fossils, finding insects, and doing jobs for other townsfolk all produce income that can be used to pay off mortgage debt or to buy carpets, furniture, and objects to decorate one's house. When my then five-year-old began playing the game seriously, he quickly recognized the dilemma he faced. On the one hand, he wanted to spend the money he had earned from collecting fruit and bugs on new furniture, carpets, and shirts. On the other hand, he wanted to pay off his house so he could get a bigger one like mine. Once he managed to amass enough savings to pay off his mortgage, Tom Nook offered to expand his house. While it is possible to refrain from upgrading, the unassuming raccoon continues to offer renovations as frequently as the player visits his store. My son began to realize the dilemma facing him: the more material possessions he took on, the more space he needed, and the more debt he had to assume to provide that space. And the additional space just fueled more material acquisitions, continuing the loop. This link between debt and acquisition gives form to a routine that many mortgage holders fail to recognize: buying more living space not only creates more debt, it also drives the impulse to acquire more goods. More goods demand even more space, creating a vicious cycle.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge is to provide a validated classification of the bounds of the software engineering discipline and topical access that will support this discipline. The Body of Knowledge is subdivided into a set of software engineering Knowledge Areas (KA) that differentiate among the various important concepts, allowing readers to find their way quickly to subjects of interest. Upon finding a subject, readers are referred to key papers or book chapters. SWEBOK Guide V3.0 builds upon SWEBOK 2004 to refresh and add new reviewed content. Emphases on engineering practice lead the Guide toward a strong relationship with the normative literature. The normative literature is validated by consensus formed among practitioners and is concentrated in standards and related documents. The two major standards bodies for software engineering (IEEE Computer Society Software and Systems Engineering Standards Committee and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7) are represented in the project. The Guide is oriented toward a variety of audiences, all over the world. It aims to serve public and private organizations in need of a consistent view of software engineering for defining education and training requirements, classifying jobs, developing performance evaluation policies or specifying software development tasks. It also addresses practicing, or managing, software engineers and the officials responsible for making public policy regarding licensing and professional guidelines. In addition, professional societies and educators defining the certification rules, accreditation policies for university curricula, and guidelines for professional practice will benefit from the SWEBOK Guide, as well as the students learning the software engineering profession and educators and trainers engaged in defining curricula and course content. It is hoped that readers will find this book useful in guiding them toward the knowledge and resources they need in their lifelong career development as software engineering professionals.},

Environmental aesthetics has emerged in the last 50 years from the philosophical fields of aesthetics and environmental philosophy. Other disciplinary perspectives have also shaped environmental aesthetics, including landscape architecture, human geography, restoration ecology and empirical studies on landscape preferences in developmental and environmental psychology. This review and synthesis mainly addresses the theoretical approaches and concepts that provide a framework to the key debates in the field, but also considers how empirical approaches have shaped recent developments, and how conceptual issues arise with respect to empirical cases. We outline the background and context of environmental aesthetics, its key concepts, and provide a critical review of contemporary theories in the field. We then consider how aesthetics features in issues pertaining to the conservation, preservation, and restoration of nature. Finally, we identify some new directions for environmental aesthetics scholarship that can productively contribute to ongoing debates regarding various relationships between people and nature.

  abstract = {Winner of the 2017 Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative Book Prize Software developers work rhetorically to make meaning through the code they write. In some ways, writing code is like any other form of communication; in others, it proves to be new, exciting, and unique. In Rhetorical Code Studies, Kevin Brock explores how software code serves as meaningful communication through which software developers construct arguments that are made up of logical procedures and express both implicit and explicit claims as to how a given program operates. Building on current scholarly work in digital rhetoric, software studies, and technical communication, Brock connects and continues ongoing conversations among rhetoricians, technical communicators, software studies scholars, and programming practitioners to demonstrate how software code and its surrounding discourse are highly rhetorical forms of communication. He considers examples ranging from large, well-known projects like Mozilla Firefox to small-scale programs like the ``FizzBuzz'' test common in many programming job interviews. Undertaking specific examinations of code texts as well as the contexts surrounding their composition, Brock illuminates the variety and depth of rhetorical activity taking place in and around code, from individual differences in style to changes in large-scale organizational and community norms. Rhetorical Code Studies holds significant implications for digital communication, multimodal composition, and the cultural analysis of software and its creation. It will interest academics and students of writing, rhetoric, and software engineering as well as technical communicators and developers of all types of software.},

The theory is intended to explain four sources of variation in behavior on this task: the kind of computation the program performs, the intrinsic properties of the program text, such as language and documentation, the reason for which the documentation is needed, and differences among the individuals performing the task. The starting point for the theory is an analysis of the structure of the knowledge required when a program is comprehended which views the knowledge as being organized into distinct domains which bridge between the original problem and the final program. The program comprehension process is one of reconstructing knowledge about these domains and the relationship among them. This reconstruction process is theorized to be a top-down, hypothesis driven one in which an initially vague and general hypothesis is refined and elaborated based on inf ormation extracted from the program text and other documentation.},

The nascent field of neuroaesthetics is advancing our understanding of the role of aesthetic evaluations by examining their biological bases. Here, we conduct a selective review of the literature on neuroaesthetics to demonstrate that aesthetic experiences likely emerge from the interaction between emotion\textendash valuation, sensory\textendash motor, and meaning\textendash knowledge neural systems. This tripartite model can in turn be evoked to explain phenomena central to aesthetics, such as context effects on preferences. Indeed, context-dependent appraisals that focus on objects rather than on outcomes could be an important factor distinguishing aesthetic experiences from other kinds of evaluations.},

This does not mean that source code does nothing, but rather that it serves as a kind of fetish, and that the notion of the user as super agent, buttressed by real-time computation, is the obverse, not the opposite of this "sourcery."},

It is widely agreed that the ``cognitive architecture'' of knowledge within the firm (the way knowledge is produced, stored, exchanged, transmitted, retrieved) strongly influences the process of organisational learning, and in turn the innovative process. As Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) emphasised, the process of creation of knowledge within firms relies on two main dimensions; the first one is the ``epistemological dimension'': the critical assumption is that human knowledge is created and expanded through social interaction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge (``knowledge conversion''); the second one is the ``ontological dimension'' which is concerned with the levels of knowledge creating entities (individual, group, organisational and inter-organisational). In line with the assumptions initially made by Argyris and Schon (1978), the organisation supports creative individuals or provides contexts for them to create knowledge.``Organizational knowledge creation therefore should be understood as a process that organizationally amplifies the knowledge created by individuals and crystallizes it as a part of the knowledge network of the organization.

Abilities like this were called ``tacit knowledge'' by physical chemist and philosopher Michael Polanyi, but here Harry Collins analyzes the term, and the behavior, in much greater detail, often departing from Polanyi's treatment. In Tacit and Explicit Knowledge, Collins develops a common conceptual language to bridge the concept's disparate domains by explaining explicit knowledge and classifying tacit knowledge. Collins then teases apart the three very different meanings, which, until now, all fell under the umbrella of Polanyi's term: relational tacit knowledge (things we could describe in principle if someone put effort into describing them), somatic tacit knowledge (things our bodies can do but we cannot describe how, like balancing on a bike), and collective tacit knowledge (knowledge we draw that is the property of society, such as the rules for language). Thus, bicycle riding consists of some somatic tacit knowledge and some collective tacit knowledge, such as the knowledge that allows us to navigate in traffic. The intermixing of the three kinds of tacit knowledge has led to confusion in the past; Collins's book will at last unravel the complexities of the idea. Tacit knowledge drives everything from language, science, education, and management to sport, bicycle riding, art, and our interaction with technology. In Collins's able hands, it also functions at last as a framework for understanding human behavior in a range of disciplines.},

Thus emerges the role of general symbol theory in developing an educational approach that attempts to over-come the dichotomy between art and science, between the emotive and the cognitive. The article also analyzes the effects of Goodman's participation in Project Zero on his aesthetic-philosophical reflections, using it to interpret both the exemplar function taken on by art in Ways of worldmaking, and the emergence of new concepts such as that of ``implementation''.},

To demonstrate the use of the framework, we examine how risk-tolerance is influenced by contextual factors and show how this trait influences programming style. We also document some preliminary components of programming style.},

  abstract = {The aesthetic and political implications of working with code as procedure, expression, and action.Speaking Code begins by invoking the "Hello World" convention used by programmers when learning a new language, helping to establish the interplay of text and code that runs through the book. Interweaving the voice of critical writing from the humanities with the tradition of computing and software development, in Speaking Code Geoff Cox formulates an argument that aims to undermine the distinctions between criticism and practice and to emphasize the aesthetic and political implications of software studies.Not reducible to its functional aspects, program code mirrors the instability inherent in the relationship of speech to language; it is only interpretable in the context of its distribution and network of operations. Code is understood as both script and performance, Cox argues, and is in this sense like spoken language\textendash always ready for action.Speaking Code examines the expressive and performative aspects of programming; alternatives to mainstream development, from performances of the live-coding scene to the organizational forms of peer production; the democratic promise of social media and their actual role in suppressing political expression; and the market's emptying out of possibilities for free expression in the public realm. Cox defends language against its invasion by economics, arguing that speech continues to underscore the human condition, however paradoxical this may seem in an era of pervasive computing.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature concerned with understanding the nature of programming skill has focused explicitly upon the declarative aspects of programmers' knowledge. This literature has sought to describe the nature of stereotypical programming knowledge structures and their organization. However, one major limitation of many of these knowledge-based theories is that they often fail to consider the way in which knowledge is used or applied. Another strand of literature is less well represented. This literature deals with the strategic elements of programming skill and is directed towards an analysis of the strategies commonly employed by programmers in the generation and the comprehension of programs. In this paper an attempt is made to unify various analyses of programming strategy. This paper presents a review of the literature in this area, highlighting common themes and concerns, and proposes a model of strategy development which attempts to encompass the central findings of previous research in this area. It is suggested that many studies of programming strategy are descriptive and fail to explain why strategies take the form they do or to explain the typical strategy shifts which are observed during the transitions between different levels of skill. This paper suggests that what is needed is an explanation of programming skill that integrates ideas about knowledge representation with a strategic model, enabling one to make predictions about how changes in knowledge representation might give rise to particular strategies and to the strategy changes associated with developing expertise. This paper concludes by making a number of brief suggestions about the possible nature of this model and its implications for theories of programming expertise.},

The principal conclusion which may be drawn is the importance of a program 'profile,' namely a table of frequency counts which record how often each statement is performed in a typical run; there are strong indications that profile-keeping should become a standard practice in all computer systems, for casual users as well as system programmers. The paper is the report of a three month study undertaken by the author and about a dozen students and representatives of the software industry during the summer 1970. It is hoped that a reader who studies the report will obtain a fairly clear conception of how FORTRAN is being used, and what compilers can do about it.},

  abstract = {Despite elegance being universally recognized as a goal for system design, there is little guidance in the related research and literature that is relevant to the design, development, or evaluation of elegant systems. This paper begins by reviewing the rather loose usage of elegance as a property of a system and shows that there are both abstract and practical views. Further, from analysis of the practical views of elegance in systems, it is clear that most current definitions of elegance are focused on the sufficiency of the system as a solution to the stated problem, rather than on elegance, perse. This paper disambiguates the usage of sufficiency and elegance, offers a formal definition of the two terms, and then provides several simple examples by way of illustration. Elegance and sufficiency must be considered as separate properties of a system, if only because the essential act of validation is an examination of the sufficiency of a solution, not its elegance. Any system attribute desired by the customer must be included as part of the solution's sufficiency and designed into the solution, not be a serendipitous unintended outcome of that design. Sufficiency is shown to be binary-a solution is either sufficient or it is not-and there may be more than one sufficient solution. Elegance is then defined to be the least complex sufficient solution. Furthermore, an elegant solution must be sufficient, but a sufficient system does not have to be (and is not always desirable to be) elegant.},

This paper explores some of the ways exemplification operates in the two fields. Both scientific experiments and works of art highlight, underscore, display, or convey some of their own features. They thereby focus attention on them, and make them available for examination and projection. Thus, the Michelson-Morley experiment exemplifies the constancy of the speed of light. Jackson Pollock'sNumber One exemplifies the viscosity of paint. Despite their similarities, science and art might seem to differ in their attitude toward facts. Science is said to adhere to facts; art, to be indifferent to them. Such, I urge, is not the case. Science, like art, often scorns fact to advance understanding through fiction. Thought experiments, I contend, are scientific fictions; literary and pictorial fictions, aesthetic thought experiments.},

In the Philosophical Investigations (ii xi) Wittgenstein makes the extremely interesting remark that when a printed triangle is seen, for instance, as a mountain, it is as if an image came into contact, and for a time remained in contact, with the visual impression (i.e. with the object as seen by me). He goes on to say that in a picture a triangular figure may have some such aspect permanently \textemdash{} in the pictorial context we would read the figure at once as a mountain \textemdash{} but that we can make a distinction between `regarding' and `seeing' the figure as the thing meant. I take him to be contrasting those common experiences in which we see a figure in a picture as depicting a person, or as a `picture-person', with those rarer experiences, referred to by art-critics when they talk of `presence', in which it seems as if the person depicted in the picture is there before us `in the flesh', and I assume that, like Sartre, Wittgenstein would suppose that imagination plays a part in experiences of this latter kind. In this paper I shall be concerned not with this sense of the presence of the object depicted, but chiefly with types of imaginal experience in which the image which seems to come into contact with what is perceived is an image of something which is not depicted or described in the work, but which nevertheless achieves a certain strength of presence.},

Many people call themselves hackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to really push the envelope. Rather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author Jon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work. To share the art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible to everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition introduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker\&\#39;s perspective. The included LiveCD provides a complete Linux programming and debugging environment-all without modifying your current operating system. Use it to follow along with the book\&\#39;s examples as you fill gaps in your knowledge and explore hacking techniques on your own. Get your hands dirty debugging code, overflowing buffers, hijacking network communications, bypassing protections, exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, and perhaps even inventing new exploits. This book will teach you how to:* Program computers using C, assembly language, and shell scripts * Corrupt system memory to run arbitrary code using buffer overflows and format strings Inspect processor registers and system memory with a debugger to gain a real understanding of what is happening * Outsmart common security measures like nonexecutable stacks and intrusion detection systems * Gain access to a remote server using port-binding or connect-back shellcode, and alter a server\&\#39;s logging behavior to hide your presence * Redirect network traffic, conceal open ports, and hijack TCP connections * Crack encrypted wireless traffic using the FMS attack, and speed up brute-force attacks using a password probability matrix Hackers are always pushing the boundaries, investigating the unknown, and evolving their art. Even if you don\&\#39;t already know how to program, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition will give you a complete picture of programming, machine architecture, network communications, and existing hacking techniques. Combine this knowledge with the included Linux environment, and all you need is your own creativity.},

  abstract = {There are several widely accepted metrics to measure code quality that are currently being used in both research and practice to detect code smells and to find opportunities for code improvement. Although these metrics have been proposed as a proxy of code quality, recent research suggests that more often than not, state-of-the-art code quality metrics do not successfully capture quality improvements in the source code as perceived by developers. More specifically, results show that there may be inconsistencies between, on the one hand, the results from metrics for cohesion, coupling, complexity, and readability, and, on the other hand, the interpretation of these metrics in practice. As code improvement tools rely on these metrics, there is a clear need to identify and resolve the aforementioned inconsistencies. This will allow for the creation of tools that are more aligned with developers' perception of quality, and can more effectively help source code improvement efforts. In this study, we investigate 548 instances of source code readability improvements, as explicitly stated by internal developers in practice, from 63 engineered software projects. We show that current readability models fail to capture readability improvements. We also show that tools to calculate additional metrics, to detect refactorings, and to detect style problems are able to capture characteristics that are specific to readability changes and thus should be considered by future readability models.},

We perform a sequence of experiments in which a total of 334 subjects are required to choose names in given programming scenarios. The first experiment shows that the probability that two developers would select the same name is low: in the 47 instances in our experiments the median probability was only 6.9\%. At the same time, given that a specific name is chosen, it is usually understood by the majority of developers. Analysis of the names given in the experiment suggests a model where naming is a (not necessarily cognizant or serial) three-step process: (1) selecting the concepts to include in the name, (2) choosing the words to represent each concept, and (3) constructing a name using these words. A followup experiment, using the same experimental setup, then checked whether using this model explicitly can improve the quality of names. The results were that names selected by subjects using the model were judged by two independent judges to be superior to names chosen in the original experiment by a ratio of two-to-one. Using the model appears to encourage the use of more concepts and longer names.},

I, and my students, have formulated the rube Project methodology around the use of 3D web-based virtual world construction of models.

  abstract = {In Aesthetic Computing, key scholars and practitioners from art, design, computer science, and mathematics lay the foundations for a discipline that applies the theory and practice of art to computing. Aesthetic computing explores the way art and aesthetics can play a role in different areas of computer science. One of its goals is to modify computer science by the application of the wide range of definitions and categories normally associated with making art. For example, structures in computing might be represented using the style of Gaudi or the Bauhaus school. This goes beyond the usual definition of aesthetics in computing, which most often refers to the formal, abstract qualities of such structures\textemdash a beautiful proof, or an elegant diagram. The contributors to this book discuss the broader spectrum of aesthetics\textemdash from abstract qualities of symmetry and form to ideas of creative expression and pleasure\textemdash in the context of computer science. The assumption behind aesthetic computing is that the field of computing will be enriched if it embraces all of aesthetics. Human-computer interaction will benefit\textemdash "usability," for example, could refer to improving a user's emotional state\textemdash and new models of learning will emerge.Aesthetic Computing approaches its subject from a variety of perspectives. After defining the field and placing it in its historical context, the book looks at art and design, mathematics and computing, and interface and interaction. Contributions range from essays on the art of visualization and "the poesy of programming" to discussions of the aesthetics of mathematics throughout history and transparency and reflectivity in interface design.Contributors James Alty, Olav W.

  abstract = {In \emph{On Doubt} , Vil\'em Flusser refines Martin Heidegger's famous declaration that "language is the dwelling of Being." For Flusser, "the word is the dwelling of being," because in fact, in the beginning, there was the word. \emph{On Doubt} is a treatise on the human intellect, its relation to language, and the reality-forming discourses that subsequently emerge. For Flusser, the faith that the modern age places in Cartesian doubt plays a role similar to the one that faith in God played in previous eras-a faith that needs to be challenged. Descartes doubts the world through his proposition \emph{cogito ergo sum} , but leaves doubt itself untouched as indubitable and imperious. His \emph{cogito ergo sum} may have proved to the Western intellect that thoughts exist, but it did not prove the existence of that which thinks: one can eliminate thinking and yet continue being. Therefore, should we not doubt doubt itself? Should we not try to go beyond this last step of Cartesian doubt and look for a new faith? The twentieth century has seen many attempts to defeat Cartesian doubt, however, this doubt of doubt has instead generated a complete loss of faith, which the West experiences as existential nihilism. Hence, the emergent emptying of values that results from such extreme doubt. Everything loses its meaning. Can this climate be overcome? Will the West survive the modern age?},

Computing and digital media are essential to the way we work and live, and much has been said about their influence. But the very material of software has often been left invisible. In Software Studies, computer scientists, artists, designers, cultural theorists, programmers, and others from a range of disciplines each take on a key topic in the understanding of software and the work that surrounds it. These include algorithms; logical structures; ways of thinking and doing that leak out of the domain of logic and into everyday life; the value and aesthetic judgments built into computing; programming's own subcultures; and the tightly formulated building blocks that work to make, name, multiply, control, and interweave reality. The growing importance of software requires a new kind of cultural theory that can understand the politics of pixels or the poetry of a loop and engage in the microanalysis of everyday digital objects. The contributors to Software Studies are both literate in computing (and involved in some way in the production of software) and active in making and theorizing culture. Software Studies offers not only studies of software but proposes an agenda for a discipline that sees software as an object of study from new perspectives.

But while most of us today can work a computer\textendash albeit with the help of the ever-present computer software manual\textendash we know little about what goes on inside the box and virtually nothing about software design or the world of computer programming. In Patterns of Software, the respected software pioneer and computer scientist, Richard Gabriel, gives us an informative inside look at the world of software design and computer programming and the business that surrounds them. In this wide-ranging volume, Gabriel discusses such topics as what makes a successful programming language, how the rest of the world looks at and responds to the work of computer scientists, how he first became involved in computer programming and software development, what makes a successful software business, and why his own company, Lucid, failed in 1994, ten years after its inception. Perhaps the most interesting and enlightening section of the book is Gabriel's detailed look at what he believes are the lessons that can be learned from architect Christopher Alexander, whose books\textendash including the seminal A Pattern Language\textendash have had a profound influence on the computer programming community. Gabriel illuminates some of Alexander's key insights\textendash "the quality without a name," pattern languages, habitability, piecemeal growth\textendash and reveals how these influential architectural ideas apply equally well to the construction of a computer program. Gabriel explains the concept of habitability, for example, by comparing a program to a New England farmhouse and the surrounding structures which slowly grow and are modified according to the needs and desires of the people who live and work on the farm. "Programs live and grow, and their inhabitants\textendash the programmers\textendash need to work with that program the way the farmer works with the homestead." Although computer scientists and software entrepreneurs will get much out of this book, the essays are accessible to everyone and will intrigue anyone curious about Silicon Valley, computer programming, or the world of high technology.},

  abstract = {Beauty. Christopher Alexander's prolific journey in building, writing, and teaching was fueled by a relentless search for Beauty and its meaning. While all around him the world was intent on figuring out how to simplify, Alexander came to embrace complexity as the only path to his goal. The Beauty and life of that which he encountered and appreciated\textemdash an Indian village, a city, a subway network, an old Turkish carpet, or a campus\textemdash lay in its well-ordered complexity. As a designer and maker he found that simplicity came from choosing\textemdash at every step\textemdash the simplest way to add the necessary complexity. The failure of so much of our modern world, in Alexander's eyes, was oversimplification, wantonly bulldozing context, misunderstanding the relationships of part and whole, ignoring the required role of time in the shaping of shapes, and ultimately dismissing, like Esau, our birthright of Value in favor of a lentil pottage of mere Fact. Ever elusive, Beauty demands of her suitors a constant return of attention to see what might be newly revealed, and Alexander duly returned again and again in pursuit of the mystery. In this essay\textemdash essentially biographical and descriptive of one man's endeavors\textemdash we examine the full arc of his work from dissertation to most recent memoir. We don't shy away from his failures, and we don't simplify his journey. We leave work done by other scholars for another day. We reach no conclusion, rather, we invite readers to reflect on what Alexander's lifelong effort suggests to them about their own path, their own sense of aesthetics and order, innate cognitive shortfalls, and professional blind alleys.},

  abstract = {Interfaces are back, or perhaps they never left. The familiar Socratic conceit from the Phaedrus, of communication as the process of writing directly on the soul of the other, has returned to center stage in today's discussions of culture and media. Indeed Western thought has long construed media as a grand choice between two kinds of interfaces. Following the optimistic path, media seamlessly interface self and other in a transparent and immediate connection. But, following the pessimistic path, media are the obstacles to direct communion, disintegrating self and other into misunderstanding and contradiction. In other words, media interfaces are either clear or complicated, either beautiful or deceptive, either already known or endlessly interpretable. Recognizing the limits of either path, Galloway charts an alternative course by considering the interface as an autonomous zone of aesthetic activity, guided by its own logic and its own ends: the interface effect. Rather than praising user-friendly interfaces that work well, or castigating those that work poorly, this book considers the unworkable nature of all interfaces, from windows and doors to screens and keyboards. Considered allegorically, such thresholds do not so much tell the story of their own operations but beckon outward into the realm of social and political life, and in so doing ask a question to which the political interpretation of interfaces is the only coherent answer. Grounded in philosophy and cultural theory and driven by close readings of video games, software, television, painting, and other images, Galloway seeks to explain the logic of digital culture through an analysis of its most emblematic and ubiquitous manifestation \textendash{} the interface.},

Here, Alexander R Galloway and Eugene Thacker present a series of investigations with the collaborative Radical Software Group (RSG). Their practice examines the nature of software code as a form of language. Addressing theoretical issues regarding meaning and representation, they argue for thinking more abstractly and generatively about language, and propose a new, or liberated, computer language in which the representational determinations implicit to any software are geared towards innovation in communication and design. By rewriting the software that allows for the transmission and translation of knowledge across previously discrete fields of production, programming allows for new and productive cross-pollination. Indeed, programming becomes a new site of design that enfolds disciplines not traditionally seen as part of the creative processes of innovation.

The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.},

The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision \textendash{} and what this book is about.},

If other programmers looked at your handiwork, would they be able to figure out the code\&\#39;s logic and purpose? Exceptional programmers have more than just technical know-how; they adopt the right approach and attitude to development.Code Craft will help take your programming beyond writing correct code to writing great code, thus turning you into a true programming professional or enhancing your existing professional skills.With language-agnostic advice that\&\#39;s relevant to all developers, Code Craft covers code-writing concerns such as presentation style, variable naming, error handling, and security. And it tackles broader, real-world programming issues like effective teamwork, development processes, and documentation. Each chapter ends with a Q\&amp;A section that reviews key concepts to get you thinking like an expert, making it an especially great reference for newer programmers who want to work professionally and efficiently as part of a team.This survival guide for the software factory will show you how to:* Write good code when the world\&\#39;s not helping you* Avoid disasters and distractions in the workplace* Assess your abilities accurately and determine ways to improve* Adopt productive attitudes and follow best practicesThere\&\#39;s little more valuable than the advice of a true, programming professional.

Methods applied range from the initial clearing away of prevalent misconceptions and the clarification of concepts, through psychological experimentation and the study of clinical work on the brain, to actual field work in educational institutions and the arts. The underlying assumption was that work in the arts, like much human activity, involves the processing of symbols. First, a grounded organization of symbol systems and functions was developed. Then questions and hypotheses concerning the abilities required for the implications of this for the arts were framed and investigated. Throughout the study, however, any question or evidence that promised to further the objective was considered. Rather than offering art educators recommendations and conclusions, the report offers materials that may be of use in their thinking and practice. (Author)},

Professor Goody argues that such an approach prevents any serious discussion of the mechanisms leading to long-term changes in the cognitive processes of human cultures or any adequate explanation of the changes in 'traditional' societies that are taking place in the world around us. In this book he attempts to provide the framework for a more satisfactory explanation by relating certain broad differences in 'mentalities' to the changes in the means of communication, and specifically to the series of shifts involved in the development of writing. The argument is based upon theoretical considerations, as well as empirical evidence derived from recent fieldwork in West Africa and the study of a wide range of source material on the ancient societies of the Near East.},

These mistakes can be caused by extremely small, isolated patterns in code, which can lead to significant runtime errors. These patterns are used in large, popular software projects and even recommended in style guides. To identify code patterns that may confuse programmers we extracted a preliminary set of `atoms of confusion' from known confusing code. We show empirically in an experiment with 73 participants that these code patterns can lead to a significantly increased rate of misunderstanding versus equivalent code without the patterns. We then go on to take larger confusing programs and measure (in an experiment with 43 participants) the impact, in terms of programmer confusion, of removing these confusing patterns. All of our instruments, analysis code, and data are publicly available online for replication, experimentation, and feedback.},

Our model suggests that processing performed immediately upon encountering an aesthetic object is stimulus driven, and aesthetic preferences that accrue from this processing reflect aesthetic evaluations of pleasure or displeasure. When sufficient processing motivation is provided by a perceiver's need for cognitive enrichment and/or the stimulus' processing affordance, elaborate perceiver-driven processing can emerge, which gives rise to fluency-based aesthetic evaluations of interest, boredom, or confusion. Because the positive outcomes in our model are pleasure and interest, we call it the Pleasure-Interest Model of Aesthetic Liking (PIA Model). Theoretically, this model integrates a dual-process perspective and ideas from lay epistemology into processing fluency theory, and it provides a parsimonious framework to embed and unite a wealth of aesthetic phenomena, including contradictory preference patterns for easy versus difficult-to-process aesthetic stimuli.},

  abstract = {The literature reports that source code lexicon plays a paramount role in program comprehension, especially when software documentation is scarce, outdated or simply not available. In source code, a significant proportion of vocabulary can be either acronyms and-or abbreviations or concatenation of terms that can not be identified using consistent mechanisms such as naming conventions. It is, therefore, essential to disambiguate concepts conveyed by identifiers to support program comprehension and reap the full benefit of Information Retrieval-based techniques (e.g., feature location and traceability) whose linguistic information (i.e., source code identifiers and comments) used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, change requests, tests, and source code) must be consistent. To this aim, we propose source code vocabulary normalization approaches that exploit contextual information to align the vocabulary found in the source code with that found in other software artifacts. We were inspired in the choice of context levels by prior works and by our findings. Normalization consists of two tasks: splitting and expansion of source code identifiers. We also investigate the effect of source code vocabulary normalization approaches on software maintenance tasks. Results of our evaluation show that our contextual-aware techniques are accurate and efficient in terms of computation time than state of the art alternatives. In addition, our findings reveal that feature location techniques can benefit from vocabulary normalization approaches when no dynamic information is available.},

Our main conclusions are that (1) the knowledge required to develop and use scientific software is primarily acquired from peers and through self-study, rather than from formal education and training; (2) the number of scientists using supercomputers is small compared to the number using desktop or intermediate computers; (3) most scientists rely primarily on software with a large user base; (4) while many scientists believe that software testing is important, a smaller number believe they have sufficient understanding about testing concepts; and (5) that there is a tendency for scientists to rank standard software engineering concepts higher if they work in large software development projects and teams, but that there is no uniform trend of association between rank of importance of software engineering concepts and project/team size.},

  abstract = {This paper describes some results of what, to the authors' knowledge, is the largest N-version programming experiment ever performed. The object of this ongoing four-year study is to attempt to determine just how consistent the results of scientific computation really are, and, from this, to estimate accuracy. The experiment is being carried out in a branch of the earth sciences known as seismic data processing, where 15 or so independently developed large commercial packages that implement mathematical algorithms from the same or similar published specifications in the same programming language (Fortran) have been developed over the last 20 years. The results of processing the same input dataset, using the same user-specified parameters, for nine of these packages is reported in this paper. Finally, feedback of obvious flaws was attempted to reduce the overall disagreement. The results are deeply disturbing. Whereas scientists like to think that their code is accurate to the precision of the arithmetic used, in this study, numerical disagreement grows at around the rate of 1\% in average absolute difference per 4000 fines of implemented code, and, even worse, the nature of the disagreement is nonrandom. Furthermore, the seismic data processing industry has better than average quality standards for its software development with both identifiable quality assurance functions and substantial test datasets.\textbackslash textless\textbackslash textgreater},

  abstract = {We live in a world, according to N. Katherine Hayles, where new languages are constantly emerging, proliferating, and fading into obsolescence. These are languages of our own making: the programming languages written in code for the intelligent machines we call computers. Hayles's latest exploration provides an exciting new way of understanding the relations between code and language and considers how their interactions have affected creative, technological, and artistic practices. My Mother Was a Computer explores how the impact of code on everyday life has become comparable to that of speech and writing: language and code have grown more entangled, the lines that once separated humans from machines, analog from digital, and old technologies from new ones have become blurred. My Mother Was a Computer gives us the tools necessary to make sense of these complex relationships. Hayles argues that we live in an age of intermediation that challenges our ideas about language, subjectivity, literary objects, and textuality. This process of intermediation takes place where digital media interact with cultural practices associated with older media, and here Hayles sharply portrays such interactions: how code differs from speech; how electronic text differs from print; the effects of digital media on the idea of the self; the effects of digitality on printed books; our conceptions of computers as living beings; the possibility that human consciousness itself might be computational; and the subjective cosmology wherein humans see the universe through the lens of their own digital age. We are the children of computers in more than one sense, and no critic has done more than N. Katherine Hayles to explain how these technologies define us and our culture. Heady and provocative, My Mother Was a Computer will be judged as her best work yet.},

  abstract = {Lulled into somnolence by five hundred years of print, literary analysis should awaken to the importance of media-specific analysis, a mode of critical attention which recognizes that all texts are instantiated and that the nature of the medium in which they are instantiated matters. Central to repositioning critical inquiry, so it can attend to the specificity of the medium, is a more robust notion of materiality. Materiality is reconceptualized as the interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying strategies, a move that entwines instantiation and signification at the outset. This definition opens the possibility of considering texts as embodied entities while still maintaining a central focus on interpretation. It makes materiality an emergent property, so that it cannot be specified in advance,as if it were a pregiven entity. Rather, materiality is open to debate and interpretation, ensuring that discussions about the text's``meaning'' will also take into account its physical specificity as well.Following the emphasis on media-specific analysis, nine points can be made about the specificities of electronic hypertext: they are dynamic images; they include both analogue resemblance and digital coding; they are generated through fragmentation and recombination; they have depth and operate in three dimensions; they are written in code as well as natural language; they are mutable and transformable; they are spaces to navigate; they are written and read in distributed cognitive environments; and they initiate and demand cyborg reading practices.},

Today's software development projects are often based on the traditional software engineering model, which was created to develop large-scale defense projects. Projects that use this antiquated industrial model tend to take longer, promise more, and deliver less. As the demand for software has exploded, the software engineering establishment has attempted to adapt to the changing times with short training programs that teach the syntax of coding languages. But writing code is no longer the hard part of development; the hard part is figuring out what to write. This kind of know-how demands a skilled craftsman, not someone who knows only how to pass a certification course. Software Craftsmanship presents an alternative\textendash a craft model that focuses on the people involved in commercial software development. This book illustrates that it is imperative to turn from the technology-for-its-own-sake model to one that is grounded in delivering value to customers. The author, Pete McBreen, presents a method to nurture mastery in the programmer, develop creative collaboration in small developer teams, and enhance communications with the customer.

Today, a probing of the role of social media as vehicles of misinformation, commoditization, andmass surveillance looms large in popular and scholarly discussions alike (Fuchs et al. 2012; Van Dijck 2013). However, there is one notable exception to this trend in the current flora of social media: since the turn of the century,Wikipedia and platforms based on the wiki-technology have been a constant source of positive wonder among commentators. This relates to the democratic nature of the Wikipedia organization, to the deliberative aspect of content production, and to the platforms' persistent avoidance of commercialism (Firer- Blaes and Fuchs 2014; Van Dijck 2013; Wright 2010).},

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate two candidate brain systems: the multiple demand (MD) system, typically recruited during math, logic, problem solving, and executive tasks, and the language system, typically recruited during linguistic processing. We examined MD and language system responses to code written in Python, a text-based programming language (Experiment 1) and in ScratchJr, a graphical programming language (Experiment 2); for both, we contrasted responses to code problems with responses to content-matched sentence problems. We found that the MD system exhibited strong bilateral responses to code in both experiments, whereas the language system responded strongly to sentence problems, but weakly or not at all to code problems. Thus, the MD system supports the use of novel cognitive tools even when the input is structurally similar to natural language.},

Jones draws on the remarkably extensive and well-preserved records of the quest to explore the concrete processes involved in imagining, elaborating, testing, and building calculating machines. He explores the writings of philosophers, engineers, and craftspeople, showing how they thought about technical novelty, their distinctive areas of expertise, and ways they could coordinate their efforts. In doing so, Jones argues that the conceptions of creativity and making they exhibited are often more incisive\textemdash and more honest\textemdash than those that dominate our current legal, political, and aesthetic culture.},

The first concerns the introduction of mathematical considerations into aesthetic discourse. For instance, it is common to mention the mathematical architecture of certain artistic productions. The second leads from aesthetics to mathematics. In this case, the question is that of the role and meaning that aesthetic considerations may assume in mathematics. It is indeed a widely held view among mathematicians, of whatever socio-historical context, not only to see their discipline as presenting a strong aesthetic dimension, but also to consider that this dimension plays a fundamental role in the process of developing and understanding mathematics. The main ambition of this paper is to show how Nelson Goodman's aesthetics can be used to justify this point of view and to propose a thesis concerning the aesthetic functioning of mathematics. This first result allows to resituate Goodman's aesthetics within a very classical tradition that will be described. Finally, the underlying ambition is to show the keys provided by Goodman's theory for the philosophy of mathematics.},

  abstract = {Most ideas come from previous ideas. The sixties, particularly in the ARPA community, gave rise to a host of notions about ``human-computer symbiosis'' through interactive time-shared computers, graphics screens and pointing devices. Advanced computer languages were invented to simulate complex systems such as oil refineries and semi-intelligent behavior. The soon to follow paradigm shift of modern personal computing, overlapping window interfaces, and object-oriented design came from seeing the work of the sixties as something more than a ``better old thing''. That is, more than a better way: to do mainframe computing; for end-users to invoke functionality; to make data structures more abstract. Instead the promise of exponential growth in computing/\$/volume demanded that the sixties be regarded as ``almost a new thing'' and to find out what the actual ``new things'' might be. For example, one would compute with a handheld ``Dynabook'' in a way that would not be possible on a shared mainframe; millions of potential users meant that the user interface would have to become a learning environment along the lines of Montessori and Bruner; and needs for large scope, reduction in complexity, and end-user literacy would require that data and control structures be done away with in favor of a more biological scheme of protected universal cells interacting only through messages that could mimic any desired behavior. Early Smalltalk was the first complete realization of these new points of view as parented by its many predecessors in hardware, language and user interface design. It became the exemplar of the new computing, in part, because we were actually trying for a qualitative shift in belief structures\textemdash a new Kuhnian paradigm in the same spirit as the invention of the printing press\textemdash and thus took highly extreme positions which almost forced these new styles to be invented.},

From the digital alarm clock that wakes us to the air traffic control system that guides our airplane in for a landing, software is shaping our world: It creates new ways of undertaking tasks, speeds up and automates existing practices, transforms social and economic relationships, and offers new forms of cultural activity, personal empowerment, and modes of play. This book examines software from a spatial perspective, analyzing the dyadic relationship of software and space. The production of space, the authors argue, is increasingly dependent on code, and code is written to produce space. Examples of code/space include airport check-in areas, networked offices, and caf\'es that are transformed into workspaces by laptops and wireless access. The book argues that software, through its ability to work universally, transduces space. The authors have developed a set of conceptual tools for identifying and understanding the interrelationship between software, space, and everyday life, and illustrate their arguments with empirical material. Finally, they issue a manifesto, calling for critical scholarship into the production and workings of code rather than simply the technologies it enables\textemdash a new kind of social science focused on explaining the social, economic, and spatial contours of software.},

Building on recent analysis concerning the philosophical underpinnings of cartography we question the ontological security of maps, contending that it is productive to rethink cartography as ontogenetic in nature; that is maps emerge through practices and have no secure ontological status. Drawing on the concepts of transduction and technicity we contend that maps are of-the-moment, brought into being through practices (embodied, social, technical); that mapping is a process of constant reterritorialization. Maps are never fully formed and their work is never complete. Maps are transitory and fleeting, being contingent, relational and context-dependent; they are always mappings; spatial practices enacted to solve relational problems (eg, how best to create a spatial representation, how to understand a spatial distribution, how to get between A and B, and so on). Such a rethinking, we contend, provides a fresh perspective on cartographic epistemology, and could work to provide a common framework for those who undertake mapping as applied knowledge (asking technical questions) and those that seek to critique such mapping as a form of power/knowledge (asking ideological questions). We illustrate our argument through an analysis of mapping practices.},

Such a goal has been a continually recurring theme during the ensuing years; for example, we read in 1970 of the ``first steps toward transforming the art of programming into a science'' [26]. Meanwhile we have actually succeeded in making our discipline a science, and in a remarkably simple way: merely by deciding to call it ``computer science.''},

According to the nineteenth century studies, Leibniz's lingua characteristica was supposed to be a language with which the truths of science and the constitution of its concepts could be accurately expressed. I argue that this is exactly what the Begriffsschrift is: it is a language, since, unlike calculi, its sentential expressions express truths, and it is a characteristic language, since the meaning of its complex expressions depend only on the meanings of their constituents and on the way they are put together. In fact it is in itself already a science composed in accordance with the Classical Model of Science. What makes the Begriffsschrift so special is that Frege is able to accomplish these goals with using only grammatical or syncategorematic terms and so has a medium with which he can try to show analyticity of the theorems of arithmetic.},

This pluralistic mode, dethroning neuroscience from its usual hegemony, seems best poised to address heretofore neglected issues in neuroaesthetics research. I address several dichotomous tensions\textemdash high versus low art, the drive for creative innovation versus evolutionarily canalized aesthetic biases, and explicit versus implicit aspects of aesthetic cognition\textemdash to identify promising future research directions, which can best be fulfilled though interdisciplinary cooperation and debate, with a continued emphasis on evolutionary theory.},

However, by analyzing formal information the informal semantics contained in the vocabulary of source code are overlooked. To understand software as a whole, we need to enrich software analysis with the developer knowledge hidden in the code naming. This paper proposes the use of information retrieval to exploit linguistic information found in source code, such as identifier names and comments. We introduce Semantic Clustering, a technique based on Latent Semantic Indexing and clustering to group source artifacts that use similar vocabulary. We call these groups semantic clusters and we interpret them as linguistic topics that reveal the intention of the code. We compare the topics to each other, identify links between them, provide automatically retrieved labels, and use a visualization to illustrate how they are distributed over the system. Our approach is language independent as it works at the level of identifier names. To validate our approach we applied it on several case studies, two of which we present in this paper. Note: Some of the visualizations presented make heavy use of colors. Please obtain a color copy of the article for better understanding.},

In this paper, we present the basis of a Core Ontology of Programs and Software (COPS) which integrates the field's main concepts. But, above all, we emphasize the method used to build the ontology. In fact, COPS specializes not only the DOLCE foundational ontology ("Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering", Masolo et al., 2003) but also core ontologies of domains (e.g. artefacts, documents) situated on a higher abstraction level. This approach enables us to take into account the "dual nature" of computer programs, which can be considered as both syntactic entities (well-formed expressions in a programming language) and artefacts whose function is to enable computers to process information.},

We shall explain why modern art's large number of individualized styles, innovativeness and conceptuality offer positive aesthetic experiences. Moreover, the challenge of art is mainly driven by a need for understanding. Cognitive challenges of both abstract art and other conceptual, complex and multidimensional stimuli require an extension of previous approaches to empirical aesthetics. We present an information-processing stage model of aesthetic processing. According to the model, aesthetic experiences involve five stages: perception, explicit classification, implicit classification, cognitive mastering and evaluation. The model differentiates between aesthetic emotion and aesthetic judgments as two types of output.},

  abstract = {Threads are a seemingly straightforward adaptation of the dominant sequential model of computation to concurrent systems. Languages require little or no syntactic changes to support threads, and operating systems and architectures have evolved to efficiently support them. Many technologists are pushing for increased use of multithreading in software in order to take advantage of the predicted increases in parallelism in computer architectures. In this paper, I argue that this is not a good idea. Although threads seem to be a small step from sequential computation, in fact, they represent a huge step. They discard the most essential and appealing properties of sequential computation: understandability, predictability, and determinism. Threads, as a model of computation, are wildly nondeterministic, and the job of the programmer becomes one of pruning that nondeterminism. Although many research techniques improve the model by offering more effective pruning, I argue that this is approaching the problem backwards. Rather than pruning nondeterminism, we should build from essentially deterministic, composable components. Nondeterminism should be explicitly and judiciously introduced where needed, rather than removed where not needed. The consequences of this principle are profound. I argue for the development of concurrent coordination languages based on sound, composable formalisms. I believe that such languages will yield much more reliable, and more concurrent programs.}

From the very beginning of the history of computer programming, it was recognized that the technical logic of programming is a logic of automation, indeed, a logic of self-automation or even recursive automation. This article suggests that a syntactic feature common to all programming languages used today serves as a register of this logic of automation, leaving traces in code that are legible if one knows where to look. That feature is the comment: natural-language text within a computer program that is written exclusively for human readers of the program and is separated from executable code, though it stands alongside it. At their most interesting, in patterns of use to which a managerial discourse of software craftspersonship is actively hostile, yet to which so-called literate programming practice is indifferent, program comments are traces of a mode of technical labor whose privilege and precarity both rest on its obscurity, an obscurity in no way resistant to reading.}

Cyberspace will no longer be a world of relative freedom; instead it will be a world of perfect control where our identities, actions, and desires are monitored, tracked, and analyzed for the latest market research report.

Code And Other Laws of Cyberspace is an exciting examination of how the core values of cyberspace as we know it\textemdash intellectual property, free speech, and privacy-\textemdash are being threatened and what we can do to protect them. Lessig shows how code\textemdash the architecture and law of cyberspace\textemdash can make a domain, site, or network free or restrictive; how technological architectures influence people's behavior and the values they adopt; and how changes in code can have damaging consequences for individual freedoms.

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the activity of single fibers in the optic nerve of a frog. Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog.},

With updated material from noteworthy hackers such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Stallman, and Steve Wozniak, Hackers is a fascinating story that begins in early computer research labs and leads to the first home computers.Levy profiles the imaginative brainiacs who found clever and unorthodox solutions to computer engineering problems. They had a shared sense of values, known as "the hacker ethic," that still thrives today. Hackers captures a seminal period in recent history when underground activities blazed a trail for today's digital world, from MIT students finagling access to clunky computer-card machines to the DIY culture that spawned the Altair and the Apple II.},

The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.},

From deCSS to Java, from Linux to Extreme Programming, this book analyses software artworks, operating systems, commercial products, infrastructures, and programming practices. It explores social forms, identities, materialities, and power relations associated with software, and it asks how software provokes the re-thinking of production, consumption and distribution as entwined cultural processes. Cutting Code argues that analysis of code as a mosaic of algorithms, protocols, infrastructures, and programming conventions offers valuable insights into how contemporary social formations invent new kinds of personhood and new ways of acting.},

  abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code ``on the fly'' into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer\textendash but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code\textendash lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code\textendash of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and ``smells'' gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

Some mathematicians claim also that beauty acts as a guide in making mathematical discoveries and that beauty is an objective factor in establishing the validity and importance of a mathematical result. The combination of subjective and objective aspects makes mathematical beauty an intriguing phenomenon for philosophers as well as mathematicians. This chapter analyzes the concept of mathematical beauty\textemdash especially the forms of beauty that mathematicians appreciate in and demand of mathematical proofs. This analysis will help ascertain how mathematical beauty can play both a subjective role in the experience of mathematicians and an objective role in the appraisal of mathematical proofs and other results. First, let us clarify a few fundamental terms. How should we interpret an observer's claim that a certain entity is beautiful? The most natural interpretation is that the entity has a property named ``beauty,'' which the observer has perceived. I do not regard this interpretation as satisfactory, however. I regard beauty as a value that is projected into or attributed to objects by observers, not a property that intrinsically resides in objects. This philosophical viewpoint is known as projectivism. Whether an observer projects beauty into an object is determined by two factors: 2},

The manual describes LISP, a formal mathematical language. LISP differs from most programming languages in three important ways. The first way is in the nature of the data. In the LISP language, all data are in the form of symbolic expressions usually referred to as S-expressions, of indefinite length, and which have a branching tree-type of structure, so that significant subexpressions can be readily isolated. In the LISP system, the bulk of the available memory is used for storing S-expressions in the form of list structures. The second distinction is that the LISP language is the source language itself which specifies in what way the S-expressions are to be processed. Third, LISP can interpret and execute programs written in the form of S-expressions. Thus, like machine language, and unlike most other high level languages, it can be used to generate programs for further executions.},

  abstract = {To make Warren McCulloch\&\#39;s essay \&quot;THE PAST OF A DELUSION\&quot; from the year 1953 now available in a German translation is in need to be explained. Den aus dem Jahr 1953 stammenden Aufsatz \&quot;THE PAST OF A DELUSION\&quot; von Warren McCulloch als Arbeitstext auch in deutscher Sprache zuganglich zu machen, bedarf einer erlauternden Anmerkung. Undoubtedly Warren Sturgis McCulloch is one of the leading scientists of the 20th century. His influence ranges from the early days of the Macy-Conferences over MIT and Biological Computer Lab in Urbana, Illinois to the foundation of the renowned \&quot;Santa Fe Institute for Sciences of Complexity\&quot;, where one of the more prominent collaborators was the physician, biochemist and biophysicist Stuart Kauffman, a temporary disciple of McCulloch. Before McCulloch returned to the academic world and together with the mathematician Walter Pitts introduced in his most widely known work the theoretical concept of the MCCulloch-Pitts-neuron and verified, that Turing-computable problems are in general computable with a network composed of a finite number of McCulloch-Pitts-neurons, from 1927 to 1934 he worked at Bellevue-Hospital in New York. We mention this, because the essay available here is coined by a selfconcept of a scientist and a physician. Warren Sturgis McCulloch ist unbestritten einer der wichtigsten Wissenschaftler des 20. Jahrhunderts. Sein Einflus reicht von den fruhen Tagen der Macy-Konferenzen uber das MIT und das Biological Computer Lab in Urbana, Illinois, bis hin zur Grundung des renommierten \&quot;Santa Fe Institute for Sciences of Complexity\&quot;, zu dessen bekannteren Mitarbeitern der Mediziner, Biochemiker und Biophysiker Stuart Kauffman gehorte, zeitweilig ein Schuler McCullochs. 1927 bis 1934, bevor McCulloch, einer der Vater von Kybernetik und Neuroinformatik, in die akademische Welt zuruckkehrte und in seiner wohl bekanntesten Arbeit zusammen mit dem Mathematiker Walter Pitts das theoretische Konzept des McCullochPitts-Neurons einfuhrte und nachwies, dass turing-berechenbare Probleme sich allgemein mit einem endlichen Netz von McCulloch-PittsNeuronen berechnen lassen, arbeitete er als Arzt im Bellevue-Hospital in New York. Wir erwahnen das, weil der hier bereitgestellte Aufsatz uber weite Strecken von einem Selbstverstandnis als Wissenschaftler und Arzt getragen ist. The essay was written for the Chicago Literary Club and is part of the monograph \&quot;Embodiments of Mind\&quot;, an overall view of McCulloch\&\#39;s works. The German edition of the monograph \&quot;Verkorperungen des Geistes\&quot; contains only 13 of the 21 articles of the English original edition, amongst others, also this essay is missing. Der Aufsatz wurde erstellt fur den Chicagoer Literaturverein und ist Bestandteil der Monographie \&quot;Embodiments of Mind\&quot;, einer Gesamtschau der McCulloch\&\#39;schen Arbeiten. Die deutsche Ausgabe der Monographie \&quot;Verkorperungen des Geistes\&quot; enthalt nur 13 der insgesamt 21 Arbeiten der englischen Originalausgabe, u.a. fehlt auch dieser Aufsatz.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

Or is computing a resource or commodity \textendash{} like water \textendash{} which is perfectly well understood in terms of existing science, for which we merely have to find more and better uses?In this essay I argue that a rich conceptual development is in progress, to which we cannot predict limits, and whose outcome will be a distinct science. This development has all the excitement and unpredictability of any science. We cannot predict how the conceptual landscape will lie in a decade's time; the subject is still young and has many surprises in store, and there is no sure way to extrapolate from the concepts which we now understand to those which will emerge. I therefore support my argument by explaining in outline some semantic ideas which have emerged in the last two or three decades, and some which are just now emerging.I try to present the ideas here in a way which is accessible to someone with an understanding of programming and a little mathematical background. This volume aims to give a balanced picture of computer science; to achieve this, those parts which are mathematical must be presented as such. The essence of foundational work is to give precise meaning to formulations of processes and information; clearly, we should employ mathematics in this work whenever it strengthens our analytical power. Thus, rather than avoiding equations, I try to surround them with helpful narrative.It is a somewhat arbitrary matter to decide when a scientific discipline is mature and stands significantly on its own.},

Neil Armstrong responded by switching off the automatic mode and taking direct control. He stopped monitoring the computer and began flying the spacecraft, relying on skill to land it and earning praise for a triumph of human over machine. In Digital Apollo, engineer-historian David Mindell takes this famous moment as a starting point for an exploration of the relationship between humans and computers in the Apollo program. In each of the six Apollo landings, the astronaut in command seized control from the computer and landed with his hand on the stick. Mindell recounts the story of astronauts' desire to control their spacecraft in parallel with the history of the Apollo Guidance Computer. From the early days of aviation through the birth of spaceflight, test pilots and astronauts sought to be more than ``spam in a can'' despite the automatic controls, digital computers, and software developed by engineers.Digital Apollo examines the design and execution of each of the six Apollo moon landings, drawing on transcripts and data telemetry from the flights, astronaut interviews, and NASA's extensive archives. Mindell's exploration of how human pilots and automated systems worked together to achieve the ultimate in flight\textemdash a lunar landing\textemdash traces and reframes the debate over the future of humans and automation in space. The results have implications for any venture in which human roles seem threatened by automated systems, whether it is the work at our desktops or the future of exploration.},

  abstract = {The first MATLAB (the name is short for ``Matrix Laboratory'') was not a programming language. Written in Fortran in the late 1970s, it was a simple interactive matrix calculator built on top of about a dozen subroutines from the LINPACK and EISPACK matrix software libraries. There were only 71 reserved words and built-in functions. It could be extended only by modifying the Fortran source code and recompiling it. The programming language appeared in 1984 when MATLAB became a commercial product. The calculator was reimplemented in C and significantly enhanced with the addition of user functions, toolboxes, and graphics. It was available initially on the IBM PC and clones; versions for Unix workstations and the Apple Macintosh soon followed. In addition to the matrix functions from the calculator, the 1984 MATLAB included fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The Control System Toolbox appeared in 1985 and the Signal Processing Toolbox in 1987. Built-in support for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations also appeared in 1987. The first significant new data structure, the sparse matrix, was introduced in 1992. The Image Processing Toolbox and the Symbolic Math Toolbox were both introduced in 1993. Several new data types and data structures, including single precision floating point, various integer and logical types, cell arrays, structures, and objects were introduced in the late 1990s. Enhancements to the MATLAB computing environment have dominated development in recent years. Included are extensions to the desktop, major enhancements to the object and graphics systems, support for parallel computing and GPUs, and the ``Live Editor'', which combines programs, descriptive text, output and graphics into a single interactive, formatted document. Today there are over 60 Toolboxes, many programmed in the MATLAB language, providing extended capabilities in specialized technical fields.},

Programs are visualized wholistically as three-dimensional structures. In this, aesthetics plays a special part: the structure must please optically, be elegant\textemdash then it is functionally acceptable. Logical mistakes manifest themselves as interfering with this aesthetics. The author suggests that in the area of software as well there is something like the absolute beautiful: perfect solutions with a maximum of transparence beyond all rivaling design parameters.

CDA rests on the notion that the way we use language is purposeful, regardless of whether discursive choices are conscious or unconscious. CDA takes a number of different approaches and incorporates a variety of methods that depend on research goals and theoretical perspectives. This methodological guide presents a general CDA analytic framework and illustrates the application of that framework to a systematic literature review of CDA studies in education. CDA research studies are no less likely than other forms of scholarly research to reproduce ideological assumptions; qualitative rigor and trustworthiness are discussed.},

The first steps then in the quest for artificial intelligence involved identifying some specific tasks thought to require intelligence and figuring out how to get machines to do them. Solving puzzles, playing games such as chess and checkers, proving theorems, answering simple questions, and classifying visual images were among some of the problems tackled by the early pioneers during the 1950s and early 1960s. Although most of these were laboratory-style, sometimes called ``toy,'' problems, some real-world problems of commercial importance, such as automatic reading of highly stylized magnetic characters on bank checks and language translation, were also being attacked. (As far as I know, Seymour Papert was the first to use the phrase ``toy problem.'' At a 1967 AI workshop I attended in Athens, Georgia, he distinguished among tau or ``toy'' problems, rho or real-world problems, and theta or ``theory'' problems in artificial intelligence. This distinction still serves us well today.)In this part, I'll describe some of the first real efforts to build intelligent machines. Some of these were discussed or reported on at conferences and symposia \textendash{} making these meetings important milestones in the birth of AI. I'll also do my best to explain the underlying workings of some of these early AI programs.},

Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.},

Even though previous research has compared specific formatting elements to find out which alternatives affect code legibility, seeing the bigger picture of what makes code more or less legible is challenging. Goal: We aim to find which formatting elements have been investigated in empirical studies and which ones were found to be more legible for human subjects. Method: We conduct a systematic literature review and identify 12 papers that compare alternative formatting elements. We organize these formatting elements using a card sorting method. Results: We identify 29 formatting elements, which are about formatting styles, spacing, block delimiters, long or complex code lines, and word boundary styles. While some formatting elements were found to be statistically better than other equivalent ones, e.g., camel case over underscore, others were not, e.g., pretty-printed vs. disrupted layout. For some alternatives, divergent results were found, e.g., one study found a significant difference in favor of 2-space indentation, but two other studies did not find it. Conclusion: Our results can serve as guidelines for developers in choosing ways to format their code and help researchers in developing, e.g., recommendation systems, to aid developers to make their code more legible.},

In this unique and insightful book, leading computer scientists offer case studies that reveal how they found unusual, carefully designed solutions to high-profile projects. You will be able to look over the shoulder of major coding and design experts to see problems through their eyes. This is not simply another design patterns book, or another software engineering treatise on the right and wrong way to do things. The authors think aloud as they work through their project's architecture, the tradeoffs made in its construction, and when it was important to break rules. Beautiful Code is an opportunity for master coders to tell their story. All author royalties will be donated to Amnesty International. tion.},

Although many people are participating in the change, few realize that the change is occurring and even fewer know why it is happening. This article explains why scripting languages will handle many of the programming tasks in the next century better than system programming languages. System programming languages were designed for building data structures and algorithms from scratch, starting from the most primitive computer elements. Scripting languages are designed for gluing: They assume the existence of a set of powerful components and are intended primarily for connecting components. System programming languages are strongly typed to help manage complexity, while scripting languages are typeless to simplify connections among components and provide rapid application development. Scripting languages and system programming languages are complementary, and are typically used together in component frameworks. However, several recent trends have greatly expanded the applicability of scripting languages. These trends will continue over the next decade, with more and more new applications written entirely in scripting languages and system programming languages used primarily for creating components.},

  abstract = {A paradigmatic aesthetic experience is a perceptual experience focusedon the beauty of an object like a work of art or an aspect of nature.Some philosophers take it that this is the only kind of aestheticexperience, though many more take it that there are other varieties aswell. You might, for instance, have an aesthetic experience bywitnessing not a beautiful but a sublime storm. You mighthave an aesthetic experience not by having a perceptual but rather byhaving an (imagined) emotional experience of the deep suffering ofSethe expressed in Toni Morrison's great novel Beloved.Perhaps you might even have an aesthetic experience by appreciatingthe way in which an elegant theorem reorganizes your thought about amathematical structure., Philosophical work on art and beauty in the Western tradition extendsback at least as far as the ancient Greeks, but the concept ofaesthetic experience as such emerged in this tradition only in the18th century. Not all who work in this area take any formof experience to be the most fundamental concept for aesthetic theory;others take evaluative aesthetic judgments, or the aesthetic value ofobjects themselves, to be more basic in explaining the relevantphenomena. This entry discusses all those views in the Westerntradition with any theory of aesthetic experience at all\textemdash notonly those views that take aesthetic experience to be fundamental., Philosophers use the idea of a distinctively aestheticexperience for several different purposes. Some use it to defend deep,effortful engagement with the arts or art criticism (Shelley 1832[2003]). Some use it to give a substantive definition of art (Tolstoy1897 [2007]), or to elevate `real' art over other culturalmedia (Collingwood 1938 [1958]). Some use it to argue for the personalor social importance of an education in sensibility (Schiller 1795[1989]). Others describe aesthetic experience as a special form ofcognitive contact with the world, perhaps even with its fundamentalmetaphysics (Schopenhauer 1818 [1958]). Only a few now question theutility of the concept of aesthetic experience (Shusterman 1997, 2008,Nehamas 1998)., Given this diversity of purposes, it is difficult to say much aboutaesthetic experience that is not controversial. But a few questionscan be posed for all theories of aesthetic experience. What isdistinctive about aesthetic experience? What is valuable about havingan experience of this kind? How if at all, does it involve evaluatingits own object? Who can have these experiences, and under whatconditions? Does it make sense to say that we should havesuch experiences?, These questions will be answered on behalf of various differentapproaches to aesthetic experience in the course of this overview. Theoverview organizes such approaches along two dimensions: in terms ofthe properties of an object on which such experience focuses; and interms of various internal aspects of the experience itself.}

  abstract = {Background: The way how programmers comprehend source code depends on several factors, including the source code itself and the programmer. Recent studies showed that novice programmers tend to read source code more like natural language text, whereas experts tend to follow the program execution flow. But, it is unknown how the linearity of source code and the comprehension strategy influence programmers' linearity of reading order. Objective: We replicate two previous studies with the aim of additionally providing empirical evidence on the influencing effects of linearity of source code and programmers' comprehension strategy on linearity of reading order. Methods: To understand the effects of linearity of source code on reading order, we conducted a non-exact replication of studies by Busjahn et al. and Peachock et al., which compared the reading order of novice and expert programmers. Like the original studies, we used an eye-tracker to record the eye movements of participants (12 novice and 19 intermediate programmers). Results: In line with Busjahn et al. (but different from Peachock et al.), we found that experience modulates the reading behavior of participants. However, the linearity of source code has an even stronger effect on reading order than experience, whereas the comprehension strategy has a minor effect. Implications: Our results demonstrate that studies on the reading behavior of programmers must carefully select source code snippets to control the influence of confounding factors. Furthermore, we identify a need for further studies on how programmers should structure source code to align it with their natural reading behavior to ease program comprehension.},

Underlying hackers' technical creations-such as the Internet and the personal computer, which have become symbols of our time-are the hacker values that produced them and that challenge us all. These values promote passionate and freely rhythmed work; the belief that individuals can create great things by joining forces in imaginative ways; and the need to maintain our existing ethical ideals, such as privacy and equality, in our new, increasingly technologized society. The Hacker Ethic takes us on a journey through fundamental questions about life in the information age-a trip of constant surprises, after which our time and our lives can be seen from unexpected perspectives.},

It examines a Learning Analytics Application Programming Interface (API) from a popular Learning Management System. The API is treated firstly as an artefact based on the computational abstraction of educational principles, and secondly as an empirical entry point to investigate the emergence of a Learning Analytics infrastructure in a large Australian university. Through in-depth ethnographic interviews and the interpretative analysis of software development workflows, the paper describes an API-mediated platformisation process involving a range of actors and systems: computational experts, algorithms, data-savvy administrative staff and large corporate actors inserting themselves through back-ends and various other dependencies. In the conclusion, the article argues that the platformisation of higher education is part of a broader project that mobilises programmability and computation to re-engineer educational institutions in the interest of efficiency and prediction. However, the social-scientific study of this project cannot ignore the practical and compromised dimension where human actors and technical systems interact and, in the process, generate meaning.},

The software in the terminal provides an asynchronous multiwindow environment, and thereby exploits the multiprogramming capabilities of the UNIX system, which have been largely under-utilized because of the restrictions of conventional terminals. This paper discusses the design motivation of the Blit, gives an overview of the user interface, mentions some of the novel uses of multiprogramming made possible by the Blit, and describes the implementation of the multiplexing facilities on the host and in the terminal. Because most of the functionality is provided by the terminal, the discussion focuses on the structure of the terminal's software.},

  abstract = {A concise, nontechnical overview of the development of machine translation, including the different approaches, evaluation issues, and major players in the industry.The dream of a universal translation device goes back many decades, long before Douglas Adams's fictional Babel fish provided this service in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since the advent of computers, research has focused on the design of digital machine translation tools\textemdash computer programs capable of automatically translating a text from a source language to a target language. This has become one of the most fundamental tasks of artificial intelligence. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise, nontechnical overview of the development of machine translation, including the different approaches, evaluation issues, and market potential. The main approaches are presented from a largely historical perspective and in an intuitive manner, allowing the reader to understand the main principles without knowing the mathematical details. The book begins by discussing problems that must be solved during the development of a machine translation system and offering a brief overview of the evolution of the field. It then takes up the history of machine translation in more detail, describing its pre-digital beginnings, rule-based approaches, the 1966 ALPAC (Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee) report and its consequences, the advent of parallel corpora, the example-based paradigm, the statistical paradigm, the segment-based approach, the introduction of more linguistic knowledge into the systems, and the latest approaches based on deep learning. Finally, it considers evaluation challenges and the commercial status of the field, including activities by such major players as Google and Systran.},

The interest in open source software development has grown enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing the benefits of open source software has been key to its success.

A person who is good at programming quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a UNIX hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network hacker'. The correct term is \{cracker\}. The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see \{network, the\} and \{Internet address\}). It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see \{hacker ethic, the\}). It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled \{bogus\}). See also \{wannabee\}.},

Other variables that influence processing fluency, like visual or semantic priming, similarly increase judgments of aesthetic pleasure. Our proposal provides an integrative framework for the study of aesthetic pleasure and sheds light on the interplay between early preferences versus cultural influences on taste, preferences for both prototypical and abstracted forms, and the relation between beauty and truth. In contrast to theories that trace aesthetic pleasure to objective stimulus features per se, we propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a function of stimulus properties.},

Since the behavior exhibited by individual developers when investigating a software system is influenced by intuition, experience, and skill, there is often significant variability in developer effectiveness. To understand the factors that contribute to effective program investigation behavior, we conducted a study of five developers performing a change task on a medium-size open source system. We isolated the factors related to effective program investigation behavior by performing a detailed qualitative analysis of the program investigation behavior of successful and unsuccessful developers. We report on these factors as a set of detailed observations, such as evidence of the phenomenon of inattention blindness by developers skimming source code. In general, our results support the intuitive notion that a methodical and structured approach to program investigation is the most effective.},

  abstract = {A software modification task often addresses several concerns. A concern is anything a stakeholder may want to consider as a conceptual unit, including features, nonfunctional requirements, and design idioms. In many cases, the source code implementing a concern is not encapsulated in a single programming language module, and is instead scattered and tangled throughout a system. Inadequate separation of concerns increases the difficulty of evolving software in a correct and cost-effective manner. To make it easier to modify concerns that are not well modularized, we propose an approach in which the implementation of concerns is documented in artifacts, called concern graphs. Concern graphs are abstract models that describe which parts of the source code are relevant to different concerns. We present a formal model for concern graphs and the tool support we developed to enable software developers to create and use concern graphs during software evolution tasks. We report on five empirical studies, providing evidence that concern graphs support views and operations that facilitate the task of modifying the code implementing scattered concerns, are cost-effective to create and use, and robust enough to be used with different versions of a software system.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to integrate two outstanding problems within the philosophy of science. The first concerns what role aesthetics plays in scientific thinking. The second is the problem of how logically testable ideas are generated (the so-called "psychology of research" versus "logic of (dis)proof" problem). I argue that aesthetic sensibility is the basis for what scientists often call intuition, and that intuition in turn embodies (in a literal physiological sense) ways of thinking that have their own meta-logic. Thus, aesthetics is a form of cognition. Scientists think not in equations or words or other logical abstractions, but emotionally and sensually, using visual and aural images, kinesthetic and other proprioceptive feelings, sensations, patterns, and analogies. These aesthetic forms of thinking have their own logics that I call "synosia", from the root words synaesthesia (a combining of senses) and gnosis, "to know". Synosia denotes understanding that integrates feeling that one knows with feeling what one knows. Eminent scientists universally describe an explicitly secondary process in which such personal knowledge must be "translated" into a formal language, such as words or equations, in order to be communicated to other people. Many of the unsolved problems that philosophers of science (as well as psychologists and artificial intelligence researchers) have had in making sense of scientific thinking have arisen from confusing the form and content of the final translations with the hidden means by which scientific insights are actually achieved.}

Mathematicians, instead, are fond of passing judgment on the beauty of their favored pieces of mathematics. Even a cursory observation shows that the characteristics of mathematical beauty are at variance with those of artistic beauty. For example, courses in "art appreciation" are fairly common; it is however unthinkable to find any "mathematical beauty appreciation" courses taught anywhere. The purpose of the present paper is to try to uncover the sense of the term "beauty" as it is currently used by mathematicians.}

Tracing the origins of software to eighteenth-century French encyclopedists' step-by-step descriptions of how things were made in the workshops of artists and artisans, Sack shows that programming languages are the offspring of an effort to describe the mechanical arts in the language of the liberal arts. Sack offers a reading of the texts of computing\textemdash code, algorithms, and technical papers\textemdash that emphasizes continuity between prose and programs. He translates concepts and categories from the liberal and mechanical arts\textemdash including logic, rhetoric, grammar, learning, algorithm, language, and simulation\textemdash into terms of computer science and then considers their further translation into popular culture, where they circulate as forms of digital life. He considers, among other topics, the ``arithmetization'' of knowledge that presaged digitization; today's multitude of logics; the history of demonstration, from deduction to newer forms of persuasion; and the post-Chomsky absence of meaning in grammar. With The Software Arts, Sack invites artists and humanists to see how their ideas are at the root of software and invites computer scientists to envision themselves as artists and humanists.},

However, some studies have presented divergent findings about the usefulness of the smell concept as a tool to support software development tasks. The reasons of these divergences have not been considered because the studies are presented independently. Objective: To synthesize current knowledge related to the usefulness of the smell concept. We focused on empirical studies investigating how smells impact the software development, the code smell effect. Method: A systematic review about the smell effect is carried out. We grouped the primary studies findings in a thematic map. Result: The smell concept does not support the evaluation of quality design in practice activities of software development. There is no strong evidence correlating smells and some important software development attributes, such as effort in maintenance. Moreover, the studies point out that human agreement on smell detection is low. Conclusion: In order to improve analysis on the subject, the area needs to better outline: (i) factors affecting human evaluation of smells; and (ii) a classification of types of smells, grouping them according to relevant characteristics.},

The author not only considers each approach from several standpoints but she also illustrates each approach through extensive applications to a variety of concrete social and linguistic problems facing discourse analysts. Exercises pose problems to which each approach can be applied. In the second edition of Approaches to Discourse, Schiffrin updates and revises the content, organization and exercises throughout the book. In Part 1, she broadens the discussion of discourse analysis through more definitions, new examples, synopsis of approaches not included in the book, and discussion of data. In Part 2, she adds simpler demonstrations of the approaches, clarifies sample analyses, presents recent trends (in a new section in each chapter called "New Developments"), and revises exercises. She also makes crucial additions and revisions to the chapters on ethnography and variation, and adds a chapter on Critical Discourse Analysis.

One reason is that the professional aesthetics discourse is narrowly focused on the fine arts including literature, such that, particularly for many Anglo-Saxon aestheticists, aesthetics has become equivalent to the study of the fine arts or art criticism. Unfortunately, that makes their conceptual apparatus largely inappropriate for other fields of aesthetics, including engineering aesthetics. Another reason is that scientists and engineers frequently use terms such as ``beautiful'', which would otherwise be typical indicators of aesthetic appreciation, to express epistemic or functional approval or to popularize their activity to a broader public. It is useful therefore to start with a broad concept of aesthetic values by considering any values that are not of epistemic, functional, or ethical nature. The remaining values typically include familiar aesthetic values such as beauty, elegance, harmony (non-epistemic), simplicity and clarity, and familiarity, as well their opposites on which aesthetic disapproval is based. In addition, something can aesthetically please or displease by resemblance to something else that pleases or displeases for aesthetic reasons only, which is typically expressed by analogies or metaphors and which sometimes leads to the formation of aesthetic styles. Whenever such aesthetic values contribute to preferences in engineering decisions, there is evidence that they inform the engineering activity.},

This article, drawing on fieldwork with developers of recommender systems in the US, describes a tendency among these systems' makers to describe their purpose as `hooking' people \textendash{} enticing them into frequent or enduring usage. Inspired by steady references to capture in the field, the author considers recommender systems as traps, drawing on anthropological theories about animal trapping. The article charts the rise of `captivation metrics' \textendash{} measures of user retention \textendash{} enabled by a set of transformations in recommenders' epistemic, economic, and technical contexts. Traps prove useful for thinking about how such systems relate to broader infrastructural ecologies of knowledge and technology. As recommenders spread across online cultural infrastructures and become practically inescapable, thinking with traps offers an alternative to common ethical framings that oppose tropes of freedom and coercion.},

The first is that it demands an upfront articulation of requirements, whereas the scientists had experience, and hence expectations, of emergent requirements; the second is that the project documentation does not suffice to construct a shared understanding. Reflecting on our case study, we discuss whether combining agile elements with a traditional methodology might have alleviated these problems. We then argue that the rich picture painted by the case study, and the reflections on methodology that it inspires, has a relevance that reaches beyond the original context of the study.},

The computer programmer, the doctor, the artist, and even the parent and citizen all engage in a craftsman's work. In this thought-provoking book, Sennett explores the work of craftsmen past and present, identifies deep connections between material consciousness and ethical values, and challenges received ideas about what constitutes good work in today's world. The Craftsman engages the many dimensions of skill\textendash from the technical demands to the obsessive energy required to do good work. Craftsmanship leads Sennett across time and space, from ancient Roman brickmakers to Renaissance goldsmiths to the printing presses of Enlightenment Paris and the factories of industrial London; in the modern world he explores what experiences of good work are shared by computer programmers, nurses and doctors, musicians, glassblowers, and cooks. Unique in the scope of his thinking, Sennett expands previous notions of crafts and craftsmen and apprises us of the surprising extent to which we can learn about ourselves through the labor of making physical things.},

  abstract = {Drawing on some of the principles of humanistic mathematics rst outlined by Alvin White, this paper seeks to examine the way in which value judgments are implicated in the growth of the mathematics discipline. After a short overview of some of the roles ascribed to the mathematical aesthetic historically, I turn to more contemporary positioning of the aesthetic in order to develop a framework that oers insight into the particular values, assumptions and desires that constrain what is done in mathematics, how it is done and why. My goal, at least in part, is to bring together under one umbrella some of the recent work that is being done in the cultural ethnography and cognitive history of mathematics and, in so doing, provide a stronger rationale for the importance and relevance of aesthetic considerations in the history and philosophy of mathematics. Finally, I use this framework to promote the idea of a mathematics critic, who could do for mathematics what art critics do for the arts, namely, to not only evaluate and explain art, but to work toward establishing its accessibility and credibility. In the edited collection Essays in Humanistic Mathematics, Alvin M. White [58] describes the humanistic dimension of mathematics as including both: \textbackslash an appreciation of the role of intuition in understanding and creating concepts" and \textbackslash An understanding of the value judgments implied in the growth of any discipline [...] what is investigated, how it is investigated, or why it is investigated" (vii). For me, both these aspects relate strongly to the mathematical aesthetic in two ways. First, in writing about the importance of the value judgments made in the discipline, White points to the axiological dimension of the philosophy of mathematics, which include both aesthetic and ethical questions of what is beautiful or ugly, good or bad, and why. Second, in pointing to the role of intuition in understanding and creating concepts, I interpret White as being concerned with the informal and nonpropositional ways in which mathematical ideas derive their meaning, which},

Smith seeks nothing less than to revise our understanding not only of the machines we build but also of the world with which they interact.Smith's ambitious project begins as a search for a comprehensive theory of computation, able to do empirical justice to practice and conceptual justice to the computational theory of mind. A rigorous commitment to these two criteria ultimately leads him to recommend a radical overhaul of our traditional conception of metaphysics.Everything that exists\rule{1em}{1pt}objects, properties, life, practice\rule{1em}{1pt}lies Smith claims in the "middle distance," an intermediate realm of partial engagement with and partial separation from, the enveloping world. Patterns of separation and engagement are taken to underlie a single notion unifying representation and ontology: that of subjects' "registration" of the world around them.Along the way, Smith offers many fascinating ideas: the distinction between particularity and individuality, the methodological notion of an "inscription error," an argument that there are no individuals within physics, various deconstructions of the type-instance distinction, an analysis of formality as overly disconnected ("discreteness run amok"), a conception of the boundaries of objects as properties of unruly interactions between objects and subjects, an argument for the theoretical centrality of reference preservation, and a theatrical, acrobatic metaphor for the contortions involved in the preservation of reference and resultant stabilization of objects. Sidebars and diagrams throughout the book help clarify and guide Smith's highly original and compelling argument.A Bradford Book},

This collection includes historical writings such as The GNU Manifesto, which defined and launched the activist Free Software Movement, along with new writings on hot topics in copyright, patent law, and the controversial issue of "trusted computing." Stallman takes a critical look at common abuses of copyright law and patents when applied to computer software programs, and how these abuses damage our entire society and remove our existing freedoms. He also discusses the social aspects of software and how free software can create community and social justice. Given the current turmoil in copyright and patent laws, including the DMCA and proposed CBDTPA, these essays are more relevant than ever. Stallman tackles head-on the essential issues driving the current changes in copyright law. He argues that for creativity to flourish, software must be free of inappropriate and overly-broad legal constraints. Over the past twenty years his arguments and actions have changed the course of software history; this new book is sure to impact the future of software and legal policies in the years to come},

Mathematical beauty thus primarily involves mathematicians' sensitivity to aesthetics of the abstract.},

Because computer programs are well defined and rigid, applying semiotic theories to them will help to reorganize the semiotic theories themselves. Moreover, semiotic discussion of programming theory can provide possible explanations for why programming has developed as it has and how computation is fundamentally related to human semiosis. The goal of this book is to consider the question of what computers can and cannot do, by analyzing how computer sign systems compare to those of humans. A key concept throughout is reflexivity - the capability of a system or function to reinterpret what it has produced by itself. Sign systems are reflexive by nature, and humans know how to make the most of this characteristic but have not yet fully implemented it into computer systems. Therefore, the limitations of current computers can be ascribed to insufficient reflexivity.},

  abstract = {The identity of computing has been fiercely debated throughout its short history. Why is it still so hard to define computing as an academic discipline? Is computing a scientific, mathematical, or engineering discipline? By describing the mathematical, engineering, and scientific traditions of computing, The Science of Computing: Shaping a Discipline presents a rich picture of computing from the viewpoints of the field's champions. The book helps readers understand the debates about computing as a discipline. It explains the context of computing's central debates and portrays a broad perspective of the discipline. The book first looks at computing as a formal, theoretical discipline that is in many ways similar to mathematics, yet different in crucial ways. It traces a number of discussions about the theoretical nature of computing from the field's intellectual origins in mathematical logic to modern views of the role of theory in computing. The book then explores the debates about computing as an engineering discipline, from the central technical innovations to the birth of the modern technical paradigm of computing to computing's arrival as a new technical profession to software engineering gradually becoming an academic discipline. It presents arguments for and against the view of computing as engineering within the context of software production and analyzes the clash between the theoretical and practical mindsets. The book concludes with the view of computing as a science in its own right\textemdash not just as a tool for other sciences. It covers the early identity debates of computing, various views of computing as a science, and some famous characterizations of the discipline. It also addresses the experimental computer science debate, the view of computing as a natural science, and the algorithmization of sciences.},

By themselves, the naked strings of the language do not determine when a program is correct relative to some specification. For this, the constructs of the language must be given some semantic content. Moreover, to be employed to generate physical computations, a programming language must have a physical implementation. How are we to conceptualize this complex package? Ontologically, what kind of thing is it? In this paper, we shall argue that an appropriate conceptualization is furnished by the notion of a technical artifact.},

They frame and organize how we access the black boxes of software and machinery, which in turn organize and reconfigure society. The same holds for discourse metaphors such as virtual community, cyberspace, Web 2.0, and social network. Metaphors matter in digital praxis, literally. This study makes an intervention into the contemporary theory of metaphor by extending it with the notion of material metaphor, including a manifest for hacking digital-material metaphors.},

Most of them dier only in one or a few concepts, but this can make a world of dierence in programming. We explain briey how programming paradigms inuence language design, and we show two sweet spots: dual-paradigm languages and a denitive lan- guage. We introduce the main concepts of programming languages: records, closures, independence (concurrency), and named state. We explain the main principles of data abstraction and how it lets us organize large programs. Finally, we conclude by focus- ing on concurrency, which is widely considered the hardest concept to program with. We present four little-known but important paradigms that greatly simplify concurrent programming with respect to mainstream languages: declarative concurrency (both ea- ger and lazy), functional reactive programming, discrete synchronous programming, and constraint programming. These paradigms have no race conditions and can be used in cases where no other paradigm works. We explain why for multi-core processors and we give several examples from computer music, which often uses these paradigms.},

  abstract = {New representations of thought -- written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc -- have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity's collectively-thinkable territory. But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard. Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But less obviously, and more importantly, it is enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned. We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought. But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities -- all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding -- instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest. This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.},

Skinner's behaviorist bell-ringing box.Contrary to popular belief, ed tech did not begin with videos on the internet. The idea of technology that would allow students to "go at their own pace" did not originate in Silicon Valley. In Teaching Machines, education writer Audrey Watters offers a lively history of predigital educational technology, from Sidney Pressey's mechanized positive-reinforcement provider to B. F. Skinner's behaviorist bell-ringing box. Watters shows that these machines and the pedagogy that accompanied them sprang from ideas--bite-sized content, individualized instruction--that had legs and were later picked up by textbook publishers and early advocates for computerized learning. Watters pays particular attention to the role of the media--newspapers, magazines, television, and film--in shaping people's perceptions of teaching machines as well as the psychological theories underpinning them. She considers these machines in the context of education reform, the political reverberations of Sputnik, and the rise of the testing and textbook industries. She chronicles Skinner's attempts to bring his teaching machines to market, culminating in the famous behaviorist's efforts to launch Didak 101, the "pre-verbal" machine that taught spelling. (Alternate names proposed by Skinner include "Autodidak," "Instructomat," and "Autostructor.") Telling these somewhat cautionary tales, Watters challenges what she calls "the teleology of ed tech"--the idea that not only is computerized education inevitable, but technological progress is the sole driver of events.},

It was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was created as a free replacement for UNIX. Since then, it has spawned a large number of operating system distributions, commonly also called Linux. Linux is deployed on a wide variety of computing systems, such as embedded devices, mobile devices (including its use in the Android operating system), personal computers, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers. It can be tailored for specific architectures and for several usage scenarios using a family of simple commands (that is, without the need of manually editing its source code before compilation); privileged users can also fine-tune kernel parameters at runtime. Most of the Linux kernel code is written using the GNU extensions of GCC to the standard C programming language and with the use of architecture specific instructions (ISA). This produces a highly optimized executable (vmlinux) with respect to utilization of memory space and task execution times.Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML). Changes are tracked using the version control system git, which was created by Torvalds as a bespoke replacement for BitKeeper. Linux as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 only (GPL-2.0-only) with an explicit syscall exception (Linux-syscall-note), but it also contains several files under other compatible licenses.As with many other open-source software projects, developers are required to adhere to the Contributor Covenant, a code of conduct created by Coraline Ada Ehmke and intended to address harassment of minority contributors including women, LGBT, trans and genderqueer individuals.},

In 2005, UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML.

It also expands upon current penetration testing methodologies including new tactics for hardware and physical attacks. This book is organized into 17 chapters. The first two chapters incorporate the historical ninja into the modern hackers. The white-hat hackers are differentiated from the black-hat hackers. The function gaps between them are identified. The next chapters explore strategies and tactics using knowledge acquired from Sun Tzu's The Art of War applied to a ninja hacking project. The use of disguise, impersonation, and infiltration in hacking is then discussed. Other chapters cover stealth, entering methods, espionage using concealment devices, covert listening devices, intelligence gathering and interrogation, surveillance, and sabotage. The book concludes by presenting ways to hide the attack locations and activities.

  abstract = {A particular photograph of Roland Barthes has always fascinated me. It is a well-known image, taken by Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1963, around the time of the publication of Barthes' Sur Racine (On Racine). The image is of a youthful Barthes in an office setting, reclining in a chair. He has mute but playful eyes and a sardonic halfsmile. His legs are crossed, right over left. He wears crisply creased slacks, and a white shirt under a woollen cardigan. His right arm is hooked over the back of his chair \textendash{} a rather awkward gesture but one that nevertheless conveys confidence, perhaps even arrogance. His left elbow rests on the left arm of his chair; the left hand is raised and cocked slightly, a cigarette stub between his first two fingers and his thumb. In the background is office shelving, housing various hanging files, and, above these, a series of smaller wooden boxes.}

  abstract = {At face value, pair programming appears to be a simple, straightforward concept. Two programmers work side-by-side at one computer, continuously collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, and test. If it was as simple as plopping two skilled programmers at one desktop, there would be no need for this book. However, there are people and personalities involved, and these people are accustomed to programming alone. Pair programming offers significant benefits: quality is increased, time is saved, morale is improved, trust and teamwork grow, knowledge is shared, and learning is enhanced. However, before any pair programming can take place, participants have to accept a new way of thinking. In Pair Programming Illuminated, Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler help you fight through the exceptions, gain collective acceptance of this approach, and experience remarkable success with it. Two case studies show pair programming in practice using Extreme Programming and Collaborative Software Process as methods.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a system for the  computer understanding of English. The  system answers questions, executes  commands, and accepts information in  normal English dialog. It uses semantic  information and context to understand  discourse and to disambiguate sentences. It  combines a complete syntactic analysis of  each sentence with a "heuristic understander"  which uses different kinds of information  about a sentence, other parts of the  discourse, and general information about the  world in deciding what the sentence means. It  is based on the belief that a computer cannot  deal reasonably with language unless it can  "understand" the subject it is discussing. The  program is given a detailed model of the  knowledge needed by a simple robot having  only a hand and an eye. We can give it  instructions to manipulate toy objects,  interrogate it about the scene, and give it  information it will use in deduction. In addition  to knowing the properties of toy objects, the  program has a simple model of its own  mentality. It can remember and discuss its  plans and actions as well as carry them out. It  enters into a dialog with a person, responding  to English sentences with actions and  English replies, and asking for clarification  when its heuristic programs cannot  understand a sentence through use of context  and physical knowledge.},

In addition, the metaphors deployed in economics and geophysiology are used to demonstrate how metaphors can influence public debate, policy, and theory. The author argues that metaphors do not simply have a descriptive function but that they also carry normative connotations. Language, alongside social practices and material objects, is an important tool in attempts to construct the future. Six overlapping metaphorical themes are identified: revolution, evolution, salvation, progress, universalism, and the "American dream." A critical analysis of these metaphors, informed by a critique of the metaphors used in economics and geophysiology, leads the author to challenge the universalist claims made by some Internet enthusiasts for the inclusive potential of the Internet.}

What is the value of handwork? Why should even the roughly lacquered rice bowl of a Japanese farmer be thought beautiful? The late Soetsu Yanagi was the first to fully explore the traditional Japanese appreciation for "objects born, not made."Mr. Yanagi sees folk art as a manifestation of the essential world from which art, philosophy, and religion arise and in which the barriers between them disappear. The implications of the author's ideas are both far-reaching and practical.Soetsu Yanagi is often mentioned in books on Japanese art, but this is the first translation in any Western language of a selection of his major writings. The late Bernard Leach, renowned British potter and friend of Mr. Yanagi for fifty years, has clearly transmitted the insights of one of Japan's most important thinkers. The seventy-six plates illustrate objects that underscore the universality of his concepts. The author's profound view of the creative process and his plea for a new artistic freedom within tradition are especially timely now when the importance of craft and the handmade object is being rediscovered.},

It helped establish the accepted mathematical concept of randomness, which in turn is the basis of tools that I have developed to justify and quantify what I think is clear evidence of the algorithmic nature of the world. To illustrate the concept I will establish novel upper bounds of algorithmic randomness for elementary cellular automata. I will discuss how the practice of science consists in conceiving a model that starts from certain initial values, running a computable instantiation, and awaiting a result in order to determine where the system may be in a future state--in a shorter time than the time taken by the actual unfolding of the phenomenon in question. If a model does not comply with all or some of these requirements it is traditionally considered useless or even unscientific, so the more precise and faster the better. A model is thus better if it can explain more with less, which is at the core of Chaitin's "compression is comprehension". I will pursue these questions related to the random versus possibly algorithmic nature of the world in two directions, drawing heavily on the work of Chaitin. I will also discuss how the algorithmic approach is related to the success of science at producing models of the world, allowing computer simulations to better understand it and make more accurate predictions and interventions.},
