\chapter{Machine languages}

This chapter brings it all together: it develops on the medium itself of source code beauty: the programming languages. They will allow us to highlight two things. First, that there is a tension between human-meaning and machine-meaning, a tension between syntax and semantics. Second, it will allow us to show that what is considered beautiful in one language is not always considered beautiful in another, even though it has the same \emph{intent}, but clearly different syntax, and perhaps even different semantics.

Then, we extract form our case studies a theory/typology/nomenclature of aesthetic manifestations in programming. \emph{Perhaps we should do the theory before, coming out from the programming languages, and then apply it in case studies}.

Once we've shown the consolidated typology/expos√© of aesthetic manifestations and devices, we will look at some case studies to illustrate all our previous points: the standards established beforehand (clean, elegant, etc.), the different social contexts, the different language contexts, the lit/arch/math/eng components and most importantly the relationship between surface-level and deep-level of a program-text. These case studies include poems, operating systems, parsers. (it would be nice to find something that is very hacky, or something that is very scientific).

\section{Machine meaning and human meaning}

This talks more about programming languages, we show how the abstract artifact is tanglibly manifested. We also look at machine semantics and syntax, and finally we look at language-independent features, or language independent features.

\section{A theory}

This is where we outline a basic theory, as seen in the check-in 2.

\section{Case studies}

This shows the case studies.

In conclusion, we've shown that a lot of the questions we've raised and features we've pointed out are manifested in programming languages. From there on, we've proposed our theory about levels and distances, confirming this idea of mental structures clearly manifested in source code, and of metaphors. This has been followed by case studies which have shown, in a variety of corpuses, how these are present in specific program-texts. And, again, that aesthetics is inseparable from functionality.
