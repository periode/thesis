yullil - code art brutalism refers the _HACKMEM_ document from 1972 MIT, related to architecture: 

> Rather than designing one-off buildings, many Brutalist architects were interested in creating habitats, adaptable social complexes that were capable of supporting small communities. Examples include the Ivor Smith and Jack Lynn's Park Hill estate in Sheffield, Kunio Mayekawa's Harumi apartment block, Tokyo, and Moshe Safdie's Habitat, Toronto.
