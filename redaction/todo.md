# todo

## format

- add index
- put names of sections in the \ref{} part
- put "listing" as a a prefix for all \ref{} (maybe just global search and replace)

## conclusion

- [ ] add a note concluding on code generation via LLMs

## chap 4 - programming

- [ ] rewrite intro of chap once the whole thing is re-read -> semantic compression and spatial navigation, expression and execution

### nick notes

- __case studies__
  - i should definitely have a more comparative approach: multiple code-bases, with aesthetics which are tied to __LANGUAGE__, __COMMUNITY__ and __PROBLEM__ (question of the idiomatic). this is better than having one case study after another, completely discontinued.
  - find similar problems in different programs, see how they deal with it
  - find specific cases where the cognitive load is high
  - again, __DO IT IN PARALLEL__ as a comparative studies.

### programming languages

- [ ] in the _scales_ part, add that the structure/syntax/vocab framework is the same as dijkstra in "the humble programmer", quoted in <http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/17/2/000698/000698.html>
- [ ] on esolangs, add <http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/17/2/000698/000698.html>

### styles

- [ ] add to the idiosyncracies this index of language design <http://rigaux.org/language-study/syntax-across-languages/>
- [ ] gefen wants more on the style part, i agree

### functions

- [ ] in the case of list comprehension in Python, it is both a technical and social environment
- [ ] re-quote hayles and her regime of computation (surface, depth, etc.) when i also talk about paloque berges et. al.
- [ ] at this point i need to synthesize. rather work on _connections and disconnections_ between the social and the functional?

## chap 3 - beauty

- [ ] change section titles

## chap 2 - understanding

- [ ] recs from guido, neuropsychologists who might be interested: stanislas dehaene and christophe paillier

## chap 1 - ideals

- [ ]  add a subsubsec on verbosity?
