literature thinks the world, experiences the world, but it also produces it, doesn't just dream it

dewey: experiencing the ordinary

experience: difference between *having experience* and *having* **an** *experience*

by entering into a relationship with human (humankind, humanity), these experiences ask the question of *progress*, of stopping going forward (decceleration)


what is the margin of action of the writer in front of classical/modern/contemporary work? their margin of action as maker of fiction, as thinker of the collective

for bataille, experience is confronting danger

according to benjamin, experience can be:
- *erfahrung*, transmissible, shareable experience, sort of a collective wisdom
- *erlebnis*, interior, intimate experience, both common and incommensurable

for the writer, this interior experience is solitude, but going towards a community that has been found again (retrouvee)

the writer's experience is this enjoyment (jouissance) of the tell-able (racontable) out of knowledge, comfort, and of the un-tell-able (irracontable), from a lack of knowledge, lack of comfort

can we write essays that are also novels? going through ecstasy to get rid of representation (bacon, again). the journey is necessary to become a fiction, but we're not limited to the choice between telling and living (contra sartre)

one way is *irony*, making fun of experience to obtain it, and in it finding a "small sanctuary" to revive the flame, retake life

**what is the requirement (exigence) of literature?**
