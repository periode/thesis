style and voice: can we resist the temptation of style? why not that of the voice?

style as a sign of the times, against mass & structure, always seen as *just, rhythm, custom, practice*

**"style is a reproducible allure, even when it remains singular"** (adorno)

**pay attention to the how of existence**

**aesthetic institution of the self**

moving away from the voice, is replacing style with a focus on the speaking and spoken subject

style has:
- form
- speaker (enonciateur)
- circumstance, context

a monologue is the desire of resembling oneself (*"that which speaks in me is better than myself"*)

always in a relationship: bakhtine and intersubjectivity

not just spatial but also temporal: we've been saying things that have been said for generations (e.g. "dinner is ready!"), therefore that which speaks in me are the voices of a duplicated subject.

it is a common singularity, which perhaps necessitates a stylistic, and tonality, but never a "universal stylistic" (aka against a style of originality, once you think you're original, you're no longer original, just like cool)

#### espece d'espace, georges perec

he's looking to articulate relationships with the collective, from the individual

*"comme tout le monde, je suppose"* < slipping from all to one, so good, everyone is like everyone else, everyone has taste

it is a democratic form, which therefore becomes autobiographic(al)

his narration starts from proust, but then goes into the heteroclite, the multiple, the heterogeneous. instead of inventing or re-inventing life, it's a matter of questioning it, of revealing what makes it livable. making something unfamiliar in order to reveal its possibilities (pouvoirs) and resources. again, humor is important because it helps to highlight the de-familiarized, (unheimlich).

irony neutralizes the affects: are we like everyone else? do we do like everyone else? being protected from originality while remaining singular.

and yet the book is dominated by the tone of a voice, an inflexion, a diretion towards something else (transitivity). **the common world before the exhorbiting pretense of style**

(today we live in the society of customization, and not of style). does programming speak for itself? or does it think for itself to then speak as a machine?

list: the dream of recording which is sometimes a passage towards the operator, the operating. (against the responsiblity of a subject: *i*)

*the breach in the system, the reintroduction of the game, of play*


vadim: le monde devient une cle de lecture de l'oeuvre, et vice-versa.
