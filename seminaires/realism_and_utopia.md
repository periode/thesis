# realism and utopia in the authoritarian personality
## ici - berlin - 10.12.19

authoritarianism has a lack of antagonism, and establishes reality through sacralization of the existing order (with no alternative)

- any comprehensive (i.e. not just economic, or not just social, etc.)  theory of society has to explain its own apperance (requirement of self-reflexivity)

---

the book _the authoritarian personality_ aimed at joining social philosophy and empirical research. this was at at time when statistical modes of research were developing and it was thought that it might help with self-reflixivity, but they are not only descriptive, but also formative/generative (they create the object their study, they create _the public_, _the masses_)

both empirical but also interpretative, in which the goal is a psychoogical portrait of the potentially fascistic individual (which aspects of an individual make it receptive to fascistic behaviour?)

but there is still an interplay between social theory and psychology 

adorno's remarks: little sense to focus on the individual's psychology because fascism has risen in a world in which the category of the bourgeois is disappearing. because modern culture has been so homogenized, scoring low or high on the fascism scale doesn't make as much sense anymore

still, the qualitative inteviews is very striking (he means touching?)

the __F-scale__ (fascism scale) is accompanied by: AS (antisemtism), E (ethnocenetrusm), PE (political economy). then combining those threes with personal questions (family, self, sex, interpersonal relations, etc.)

traits: conventionalism, submission, violent response to attacks on tradiion, admiration for toughness, love for powerful figures, fear dangerous occurences, etc.

can we locate the researchers on the F-scale itself? 

sometimes they use the _kulturindustrie_ to denote all aspects of human everyday life as reifed products
- in the interivews, adorno notices that no one has the ability to think critically

---

the high-scoring individual thinks there is no utopia, but also that there should be no utopia, and that one has to be *realistic*. quote: *the overwhelming superiority of the existent* - authorianism is a posture that people adopt when looking at the social world and see an order as the only order possible/necessary **but plot twist** that trait is also seen in low-scorers

realism can also be a position which acknowledges all the forces and obstacles that stand in the way ofthe unrealized potentialities of the species (utopia)

the conclusion is "if you don't want fascists, love the children" (i.e. we need broad changes in social structures -these structures are the concession of the authors to political realism)


individuals as submissive centers of reaction (lol adorno u emo)

1. psychology is back today through political marketing (especially online), so it might seem there is no moe "inner life"
2. ideology is still alive and well in the parties today across europe, which should be identified as neo-fascists. racism is the one common, defining trait of the various strains of right-wing/far-right-wing -as it is used in negative inclusion. ideology could today be renamed _cultural style_
3. skepticism towards critique? because now there is an "alogrithm which will eat out all of our life-world" (thanks, zadie smith), then only a few theorists will be left battling the computational overtaking. but that's inherently elitist, and fascistic because critical theory has rescinded from public life. because critical theory lives between reality and utopia, it needs to stay there, in an attempt to bridge those two things

q&a

the problem with measuring inner life is (following foucault) already creating that inner life that is being measured

if there was going to be a new survey about authoritarianism today, it would be _what are your sources of information?_
