# literary theory

## abrams - four coordinates

1. expressive (the relationship between the author and the text, the role and influence of biographical elements on the text)
2. mimetic (the text as a reflection of the world, a model of the world -metaphors/universal that can be found in concrete (back to aristotle))
3. pragmatic (relationship between text and audience, reception theory/moral effect of art, their ideological baggage)
4. objective (autotelic, the text for the text and nothing else, ontological approach)

The style of writing of Zen texts has been influenced by "a variety of east Asian literary games":[12]

- The extensive use of allusions, which create a feeling of disconnection with the main theme;
- Indirect references, such as titling a poem with one topic and composing a verse that seems on the surface to be totally unrelated;
- Inventive wordplay based on the fact that Hanzi (Chinese characters) are homophonic and convey multiple, often complementary or contradictory meanings;
- Linking the verses in a sustained string based on hidden points of connection or continuity, such as seasonal imagery or references to myths and legends.

## gregory castle - the literary theory handbook

theory is a way of thinking, combining ideas and concepts meaningfully. it's either deductive (from instances to concepts), or inductive (from concept to instances). literary theory is trying to get at the life of literature, because literature is always about life. literature often uses *connotation* (subtle suggestion) rather than *denotation*.

literary theory is plagued by the idea of autonomy, the idea that it functions on its own (kant, etc.). is good literature a function of style and form? or a function of social and political ideals?

literature is pleasure derived from innovation, creativity, the love of language and its exuberant use. so literature might be the form that engages with life through exciting/mind-challenging/satisfying use of language.

Wolfgang Iser: literature is an anthropological investigation, complementary to science and philosophy. Interpreting that literature, then, is raising questions about it. (he's from reader-response theory)

traditionally, started with *mimesis* and *poetics* (greeks)

#### german idealism

then with **baumgarten** and **kant** comes the dual approach to (1) senses and then (2) reason; i.e. sensation (aesthetics) allow us to apprehend something, which appears unprecedented, and reason allows us to grasp it. *the triumph of reason generates the sublime effect* (kant) -> disinterested, universal, necessary. **schiller** introduces a dialectical movement between reason and imagination (*play*). play brings form into being. **hegel** proposes that art is self-consistent, focused inwardly, and built through a dialectic of Spirit/Reason/Geist. these three where taken up by the romantics in england, who focused a lot on imagination and play, rather than reason (surprisingly heh). but then the post-romantics wanted a bit more material, a bit more social reality (that's when criticism starts to show up).
for **nietzsche**, it was about interrogating the value of value itself, and by this value-making process, being able to determine the value of truth.
- *truth becomes a moveable host of metaphors, metonymies and anthropomorphisms, ...illusions that we have forgotten are illusions* (freddy nietzsche, "Truth")
- the artists' lie, or "untruth", brings us closer to what is true (wilde, "Intentions")

#### modernism

- *make it new* - breaks and continuities - experimentations but still essentiality
plus linguistic innovations, narrative innovations, subject matter innovations, after WWI - this is when *the literary work doesn't reproduce personal emotions, but a form of depersonalized "structural emotion" (feelings which are not emotions at all) - t.s. eliot* -> effacement of the writer (in particular through specific styles, joseph conrad, henry james, etc.).
then it keeps style but rejects mimesis (joyce, stein, kafka), and traditional realism. high modernism mixes linguistic and rhetorical styles, and hybridizes genres, manipulates different voices and temporal frameworks, in a way that deconstructs the relationship between form and content. **style becomes the vital thing** (aka language as an object). this is because it was accompanied by **saussure**, whom proposed that language did not exist in relation to existing things, but first and foremost as a coherent system (structuralism).
- *"literary texts tend to be metaphoric while non-literary texts tend to be metonymic"* - jakobson (viktor shlklovsky: through estrangement and defamiliarization, it becomes possible to see the formal processes which determine the meaning of the text). here we veer into the dangerous territory of the "self-contained", the "autonomous". it also announced structuralism (jakobson, levi-strauss who said all cultural actions can be interpreted as parts of a structure similar to language)

#### cultural and critical theory

aka here comes marxism, and his materialist analysis of society. lukacs even thought the form of the novel was problematic because it was too ideal. in the UK, **raymond williams** saw culture+aesthetic works and practices as stemming from material conditions (along with **stuart hall**, this became british cultural studies, itself influenced by gramsci, but then expanded *out of* materialism by foucault)

#### post structuralism

alternative to formalist and materialist approaches, with an emphasis on *textuality*. (Textuality is not just about the written word; it also comprises the placement of the words and the reader’s interpretation. There is not a set formula to describe a text’s textuality; it is not a simple procedure.). **barthes**'s mythologies is a "second-order" (everyday) language. **genette** builds on barthes's work with *figures*, a book about structural units of narrative constructions.
reader-response theory (coming from phenomenology) focuses on "interpretive communities", with shared reading experiences and divergent interpretations.
**derrida**: the differance is the phenomenon of endless meaning-making of objects presented, since objects are never "really" there. language is haunted by this absent presence, in which meaning is decoupled from reference (...), and the signified is always replaced by another signifier along an endless chain.
also julia **kristeva**, intertextuality (becomes "discourse" with **foucault** -his archeological method starts from structuralism (there are units, yes), but then tries to inquire into those units in a way that structuralists do not do)
for **lacan**, what matters is the *subject* and the relation of language in relation to the unconscious. he influences second-wave feminists whom, around simone de beauvoir, postulate that feminist subjectivity lies in the negation of the rational assumptions of the dominant, patriarchal, philosophical order.

#### culture, gender and history

historicization (jameson), makes poststructuralism even more prescient. **fanon**, **cesaire**, **memmi**, and edward said in this mapping of discourse formation of what the west thought of the east. **gayatri chakravorty spivak** highlighted both dominant (colonial) and revisionist (colonized) narratives about indian history and peoples. history/mastery/mimesis/colonialist vs. fantasy/displcement/mimicry/colonized. it's now about reading literary texts *deep into their social and cultural contexts*, which reinvigorates cultural studies by including *all* aspects of culture. here comes **p-diddy bourdieu** and his ideas around social fields, socialized subjectivity, etc. then taken on by **butler** and performativity (i.e. gender, and perhaps everything else, is not innate, but performed)

#### postmodernism, post-marxism

now starting to criticize theory itself -postmodernism and the doubt of any universal truths disguised as ideology or as dialectical teleology (e.g. through the state), or as *master narratives* (grands recits vs. petits recits, recits locaux, savoir pragmatic, queer af). **deleuze and guattari** see humans as desiring machines, with a desire that isn't a lack, but rather a vertigo into non-identity, and therefore the constant movement, and constant reinvention of such humans, in an aggregation of distributed knowledge through a rhizome. this all led to *an aesthetics of affects and absences, of confused representations of the real, in which THE SUBLIME STEMS FROM INCOMPREHENSIBILITY OF LANGUAGE ITSELF*. + the dead ends of alienation and narcissism itself (postmodernist literature seems to only care about representing its own operations, endless self-referentiality).
meanwhile, post-marxism is just the understanding that late capitalism distributes power in new ways (see: ernesto laclau and chantal mouffe - *hegemony and socialist strategy*), while **habermas** and **bnehabib** offer a humanist marxism, in which the enlightenment project isn't yet finished, and therefore individuals still have the chance to constitute their own identity amidst social forces (+communicative rationality). it's kinda like critical theory + postcolonialism + transnational theory. and in all of that, **kant** and **hegel** are still present, the shadow of their universality and totality being still used to rethink them in a more tactical, contingent way. this also shows that dialectics and aesthetics are still relevant. we're back to reason (via dialectics) and sensation being the nexus for art. so now we need to think of humans as different altogether.

#### posthumanism

standing against the anthropomorphism of all things (from nietzsche, marx, darwin, freud, to foucault and barthes). posthuman in the sense that the human becomes more open and multiple, less constrained by cultural codes: there are other things than human thoughts, but don't these other things have codes too? coupling of humans with nature, cyborgs, smart devices (and their unknowable way of knowing the world). mostly it is a critique of *nature*, leading to **alien phenomenology**, trying to know what objects know. from there, what is my representation of things (given my new understanding of the ontology and agency of these things)? and of their *beautiful* representation? it provides both a sharp criticism of the human condition and a pathway to hope for what lies beyond us.
