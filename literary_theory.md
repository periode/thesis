# literary theory

## abrams - four coordinates

1. expressive (the relationship between the author and the text, the role and influence of biographical elements on the text)
2. mimetic (the text as a reflection of the world, a model of the world -metaphors/universal that can be found in concrete (back to aristotle))
3. pragmatic (relationship between text and audience, reception theory/moral effect of art, their ideological baggage)
4. objective (autotelic, the text for the text and nothing else, ontological approach)
