# The beauty of Numeric literals in Ada
## Franco Gasperoni, 2008

recalling his first encounter with numeric literals in Ada, a gem

fun fact: you can insert underscores to separate groups of digits: `3.14159_26535_etc`

based literal methods: in C, it's unintuitive/strange (arbitrary), while in Ada you can write it consistently (formal) in however many bases you want (structural, base 2, 8, 10, 16)

> ada provides *exactness*, and therefore frees the programmer from the language (the limitations of writing)
