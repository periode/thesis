# the beauty of simplicity

## kristiina karvonen

more about UI aesthetics, but interesting point on how "discussion about design quality or even usability is often about aesthetics"

Jacob Nielsen: "simplicity means that users get what they came for" (the lack of complexity)

Johann Joachim Winckelmann (18th century aesthetician): *"beauty is plurality in simplicity"* but actually in software plurality can almost always amount to confusion (DRY, loose coupling)

she says ugliness connotes effectiveness (??? like audacity or vlc?)
