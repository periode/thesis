6. maximiser sa contribution

## questions

le jury risque de m'amener vers des questions dont ils sont experts, donc faire attention à leurs dernières publications

## todo

- be very confident
- talking to fast: aim for 150w/min -> __3750__, learn the script, play yourself back
- add references on all slides (bottom right)
- there are too many ideas per slide, it's hard to distinguish between my contributions and the ideas of others
- what kind of pronouns? between 'I' or 'we', it's better to go for impersonal ('we' as in 'the proper ways academics would do it'
- double-down on the state of the art, gap of the research (why was i doing this? why is it useful?)
- include the 4 frameworks (architecture, lit, math, craft) earlier
- beef up the empirical approach: add numbers, tables, sample size (representative or not?)
- add a bit more examples of code/quotes of programmers/tables
- the original hypotheses for each questions should be highlighted (was i surprised, not surprised at the outcome?)
- put the beautified/minified example at the very beginning

## content

- what's the relationship between function and aesthetics? is it parallel / is it hierarchical?
- who are we talking about? just programmers? for whom is it beautiful? does this extend to anyone else? how widely does it transpose?
- justify the reason why the focus on code and not so much on programmers?
- what about error? ambiguity?
- read about pragmatics discourse analysis
- read about computational definitions of aesthetics (CS data mining)
- read about winnie and queering code/aesthetic programming

## writeup

- add a part about how code poetry is a fringe practice but can reveal a good amount of things about what can be done with source code.
