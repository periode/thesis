## 02.01.2020

The work I've done in this first semester has been focused on two main parts. The first part has consisted in reading the literature of the state of the art which deals closest to my topic (source code aesthetic/creativity), in order to identifying existing trends and contributions, as well as perspectives for further research. The second part has resulted in the collection of primary sources, and in organizing these in rudimentary categories. These two parts, along with broader readings in literary theory in general has allowed me to highlight a more precise angle for my proposed research: *the role of programming languages as material in source code poetics.*

Recent literature about the field of source code aesthetics, broadly understood as any inquiries centering around the writing, the reading and the distributing of source code, covers fields as diverse as literature (Hayles, Black, Sondheim), science and technology studies (MacKenzie), humanities (Paloque-Berges), software studies (Montfort et. al.) and philosophy (Cramer, Cox and McLean). In particular, each of these monographs (and in some cases, catalog articles or book chapters) tend to engage with code at a level beyond that of the broad, diffuse concept. Source code excerpts, programming environments and languages form a part of the work as primary sources and *texts* to be read and examined closely, and in that sense all offer the same foray into code-as-text as my work intends to. I will first provide an overview of each contribution organized by fields, and then show how the the aforementioned research angle on programming languages fits within the existing landscape of research.

### state of the art

While most sources, because of their dealing with source code as text, incorporate some aspect of literary theory and criticism, the works of N. Katherine Hayles, Maurice J. Black and Alan Sondheim. Black, in his PhD dissertation *The Art of Code* (University of Pennsylvania, 2002) initiates the idea of a cross between programming and literature, and hypothesizes that writing source code is an act that is closer to modernism than postmodernism, since it relies on ideas of authorship, formal linguistic systems, and somewhat straightforward, *self-containedness*. The intent here is to show how code has an aesthetic, which is distinct but closely related to literary aesthetic. After highlighting how the socio-political structures of computing since the 1950s (e.g. free software vs. closed-source) have affected the constitution of a code aesthetic both in professional and amateur programmers, Black moves towards the examination of code practices as aesthetic practices. Here, Black limits himself to the presentation of coding practices as identifiably aesthetic practices, but exclusively through a social definition of aesthetic -how groups and individuals refer to their own practice- without going into further depth into the analytical questions of *what is it* that makes source codes literary texts so similar, and yet so different to human languages poetry, acknowledging that there hasn't be a rigorous literary criticism of source code poetry, an endeavor he barely touches upon. Finally, the last section of the dissertation engages in an analysis of *Finnegan's Wake* through the lens of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, hypothesizing that scripting practices and models can provide useful heuristics for the analysis of classical literature. At this point, it seems that Black operates this study in only one of two directions: by equating programming and literature, he assumes that it is possible to write about literature through the lens of source code. However, the object of his study has only been defined socially as a literary object, rather than formally, by looking at the language structures that form the basis of programming. As such, the actual analysis of source code with the help of formal literary theories is almost entirely side-stepped. In summary, Black provides a first study in code as a textual *object* and a textual *practice*, but remains short of establishing foundations of a study of code a formally aesthetic object, in particular working on the limits of what makes Perl poetry (or any other programming-language-based poetry, for that matter) different in its writing, reading and meaning-making than natural-language poetry.

N. Katherine Hayles, in her book *My Mother Was A Computer: Digital Subjects and Literary Texts* (University of Chicago, 2005) removes code from its immediate social and historical situations, and approaches it as a *worldview*, and attempts to qualify this worldview both in opposition to Saussure's parole and Derrida's trace, and in the heritage of cybernetic studies and media studies thinkers such as Friedrich Kittler and Mark B. Hansen. Specifically, she introduces her idea of the *Regime of Computation*, which relies on the formal specificities of code (among which: depth, dynamism, fragmentation, etc.). While the second part of the work, similarly to Black, focuses on the application of heuristics from the Regime of Computation to provide new readings of either classical as well as electronic literature. Source-code specific contributions are therefore found in the first chapter, highlighting the way code recombines some traditional dialectics of literary theory, namely paradigmatic/syntagmatic, discreete/continuous, flat/stacked languages, and compilation/interpretation. The closest she comes to a close-reading is when she mentions that paradigms such as OOP as opposed to procedural languages, or languages such as C++ would affect the structure and the meaning of programming texts, describing how the *syntax* of object-oriented programming reflects the syntax of human languages and therefore unlock source code as a literary text. While Hayles provides the basis for a much deeper analysis of source code's formal literary properties, she maintains that it source code studies should keep in mind the ever-underlying materiality that this very source code relies on. She locates this materiality in the embodiment of users and readers, along with Mark Hansen and Bruno Latour, considering the *wetware* before the *hardware* or *software*. Beyond the little engagement that she has with the political and economical of software development and their impact on electronic texts, she also stops short of considering programming languages, and the material apparatuses that make them possible (documentation, architectures, compilers, tutorials, conferences and communities) as some sort of material which all exhibit *family resemblances*. Such an approach of programming languages as materiality seems like a possible avenue for looking into the formal specificities of programming languages both between them and human languages, but also between one another (e.g. COBOL vs. C++ vs. JavaScript).

Alan Sondheim's essay *Codework* (ABR, 2001), as the introduction of the American Book Review dedicated to this specific form, provides another aspect of poetry that which integrates source code as a creole language which emerges from the interplay of natural and machine languages. However, this specific aspect of literary work integrating the *surface* of code rather than its structure provides more insight in the anthropology of how humans represent code through speech, rather than representing speech through code (i.e. focusing first and foremost on the structural uniqueness of programming languages). This presents an acutely postmodern view of programming languages, forcing them upon a relational, mutable conception of language as as speech-acts, and leaving aside their structural and post-structural characteristics. Codework is essentially defined by its content and *milieu*, the networked environment in which emails, instant messages and delivery reports constitute the raw material which is then fragmented and re-inserted as a contamination of the human discussion. This aspect of the interaction of between code and speech is limited in the terms of my research since it focuses more on the *parole* than on the *langue*, and limiting it to a somewhat narrow body of identified authors, mailing lists and works, a priori casting it as an established practice within the net.art movement, rather than as a potentiality for literature in general.

In a similar fashion, Geoff Cox and Alex Mclean develop in *Speaking Code: Coding as Aesthetic and Political Expression* (MIT Press, 2012) an interpretation of reading, writing and executing source code as a speech-act in the broader political sense, invoking Arendt and located, instantiated presence as a political position from which software can be understood as a semantic object affecting multiple the multiple economic, social and discursive environments in which it lives. On a purely formal level, while this study doesn't quite address the syntactic specificities of codes, it does highlight in very practical way, i.e. by including snippets of code written by either the co-author or established software artists. This shows the intention of engaging with details of source code by highlighting it through the book to support their argument. Of all the studies reviewed at this stage of my research, this is one of the most direct engagements with source code, since it includes both deductive code (commenting existing source code) or inductive code (code written to act as an example to a point developed by the authors). **DEVELOP MORE SPEAKING CODE**

Away from the cultural agency of code as developed by Cox and McLean, Cramer focuses on the cultural history of computation, tying our contemporary fascination with source code into an older web of historical attempts at integrating combinatorial practices from Hebraic texts to Leibniz's universal languages. It is in this space between magic and logic that Cramer locates today's experiments in source code (i.e. source code poetry, esoteric languages and codeworks). By relocating it there, code is no longer just arbitrary symbols, but also execution. once formal execution is considered a cosmological principle, it becomes synonymous with performative execution. Through this exploration, he extracts 5 axes along which to apprehend code-based works: totality/fragmentation, rationalization/occultation, hardware/software, syntax/semantics, artificial/natural language. While all these axes overlap each other, is the *syntax/semantics* axis which seems the most aligned with the current direction of my research. Indeed, I hypothesize that it is possible to touch upon these other thematical axes through the lens of syntax and semantics. His concept of speculative programming is also particularly fruitful as the attempt to integrate all philosophies of computation, to become a figure of thought and reflection in theory and artistic practice, and would be operational when articulated with some of the primary sources I've gathered (see below). Most importantly, Cramer states that *formalisms [...] have a cultural semantics of their own, even on the most primitive and basic level. With a cultural semantics, there inevitably is an aesthetics, subjectivity and politics in computing*. While these cultural semantics have been highlighted in multiple ways so far, how the formalisms themselves implement this culture and those semantics remain to be developed further.

Following literature and cultural studies, the last group of work is organized around sociology, science and technology studies (STS) and software studies.

*Cutting Code: Software and Sociality* (Peter Lang, 2006) by Adrian MacKenzie approaches the software first through a problem of definitions. The author establishes a relational ontology of software: it is defined in how it acts, and is being acted upon by existing structures, from intellectual property frameworks to design philosophies in software architectures. Most of the book is devoted to finding software's place inside the broader world, and therefore only defines it by what it *does*, for a lack of defining it for what is *is*. His analysis of source code poetry, focuses famous Perl poems, Jodi's artworks and Alex McLean's *forkbomb.pl* and highlights the executability of code as its dominant feature, dismissing Perl poetry as *a relatively innocuous and inconsequential activity* which should really be considered through the lens of being a gateway towards understanding the executability of code through its textuality, rather than stopping to examine textuality for itself, which he only addresses in passing. While software could indeed be a *patterning of social relations*, it would also be possible to explore these social relations as happening through linguistic means. In the end, MacKenzie's work helps putting into perspective the very issues of being able to even define software itself.

Camille Paloque-Berges published, a couple of years later, *Poetique des Codes sur le reseau informatique* (Editions des Archives Contemporaines, 2009). This work deploys both linguistic and cultural studies theorists (Barthes, De Certeau) in order to explain the playful acts of source code poetry, esoteric languages and net.art. While the first chapter focuses on digital literature as executed code in order to develop a heuristic to approach source code, and while the third and last chapter focuses on the means of distribution of these works, and particularly the impact of the Internet on the development of net.art, 13375p34k and codeworks, the second chapter is the most relevant to the topic of a literary analysis of source code works. In that chapter, Paloque-Berges provides an introduction of creative acts in source code on both a conceptual level (drawing from Hayles and Montfort) and a technical level, looking at specific programming structures ("hello world", quines, etc.), technical syntax (`$`, `@` as perl tokens for expressing singular or plurals) and cultural paradigms (De Certeau's tactics vs. strategies). The second chapter of the book, in which she establishes these analyses is an example that I would like to build upon, developing closer readings of the formal, linguistic aspects of those source code pieces. Paloque-Berges's work establishes this field as a valid field of study which invites further work to be done.

Finally, *10 PRNT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)) : GOTO 10;* is a collaborative work which examines the cultural intertwinings of a single line of code, through hardware, language, syntax, outputs and themes. This is an example of rigorous close-reading of source code, in a clearly deductive fashion, working from the words on the screen and elaborating the context within which these words exist, in order to establish the cultural relevance of source code. While the study itself, being a close-reading of only one work, and particularly a *one-liner*, is restricted in terms of broad aesthetic statements, it does show how it is possible to talk about code not as an abstract construct but as an instantiated reality.

#### transition

summary of contributions:
- source code poetry is always acknowledged, as the creativity in software, but strongly limited to perl and C
- useful concepts (double coding)
- esoteric languages a little less
- programming languages not at all
- human and machine are mutually influenced, in speech and thought
- separation between "art programming" and "regular programming" as sharing different sets of aesthetics
- - could "art programming" be a gateway towards opening up the definition of literature
- - paying attention to "art programming" allows to pay attention to programming in general

**which aspect of this literature do i feel closest to?**

#### DISCIPLINES / PERSPECTIVES / CONTRIBUTIONS

##### mostly literature

**katherine hayles - 3 worldviews** [*literature, cybernetics*], includes code within a world-making system of its own, in relation with speech and writing. it is the worldview of computation (to be developed). code works in specific ways (and she develops it through 9 points that aren't unlike *hamlet on the holodeck*), and therefore should be taken into account when examining texts. the closest that she gets to is something following the specificity of object-oriented programming (see also: galloway).

*contribution: the close analysis of code as a means of literary expression, and explanation of how it stands differently than speech and writing in saussure and derrida's conceptions, and the contribution to code as a literary and narrative event. she also touches upon some interesting ideas of materiality, which is making me think that one could see specific programming languages as a material*

---
**maurice black - the art of code** [*literature, computer science*] initiates the idea of a cross between programming and literature, and assesses that programming is closer to modernism than postmodernism (which i agree to some extent)

---
**alan sondheim - codework** [*art, literature*], an introduction and a typology of codeworks as the interplay between machine and human languages.


*contributions: speech integrates code to make it more machine-like, but how does code integrate speech/writing to make it more human-like? and not just in terms of EFFICIENCY*

---

##### mostly cultural studies

**florian cramer - words made flesh** [*art history, cultural studies*]: he puts the accent on pre-existing practices when it comes to literary text, by linking objects and texts today to practices and approaches from before. he integrates source code into a bigger structure, a gradient of all formal systems from binary/assembly to english and hebrew. source code in 50s->10s programming languages is only a small subset of this.

*contribution: brings in a typology of the poetics of formally executable code, as well as the construction of a philosophico-epistemological framework. (i.e. how people who came before tried to think about how and why of formal systems)*

---
**geoff cox alex mclean - speaking code** [*political science, engineering, art*], explains how programming is a political act by looking at it through the lens of the speech-act, the pronounciation, and therefore the subjective, local, temporary moment of happening of the software. they invoke political philosophers (marx, arendt) to show how software lives in a bigger political ecosystem that (1) cannot be ignored and (2) can be quite effectively addressed.

*contribution: approaches code through the deliberate frame of the voice and speech, and therefore integrate cultural/postmodern/almost-feminist approach to the code. they also actually write code snippets to demonstrate their points.*

---

##### mostly software studies, platform studies

**various artists - 10PRNT(CHR(220.5+RND(1)))GOTO10** [*software studies*], a close analysis of each part of the code (semantic and conceptual, both).

*contribution: a style exercise of how close-reading of source code could/should look like.*

---
**camille paloque berges - poetique des codes** [*sociology, literature*]: good overview of what was done 10 years ago. particular interest in the social aspect of those practices (network effect, relationship to modes of communication (usenet, bbs) or production (FOSS, GNU)). she does summon de certeau and foucault.

- code is a material symbol (marx)
- concept of double-coding
- linguistic models

*contribution: brings in the mode of existence of the programmers in how they are intertwined with their tools/media and how they try to appropriate them in a similar way that de certeau said. codeworks are a creole language which are however making code appear on the surface* but *source code submits to human code, which results into an assimilation, and not a fusion.*

---

**adrian mckenzie - cutting code** [*science and technology studies*] a thorough analysis of the socio-economical structures in which code is created, acted and received, with several layers (from kernel to large infrastructure and speculative prototypes). however, for a book that talks about code, there are very few lines of actual code. he develops an ontology and says that *every programming language is already an ontology* (a software ecosystem is a patterning of social relations)

*contribution: description of the socio-economical conditions in which software is produced*

---

#### II - constitution of the corpus

- programming languages
- modules / libraries
- poems
- book: if hemingway wrote javascript
- peripheral texts (manuals, man pages, style guides, documentations)
- books about programming
- forum and BBS discussions
- blog posts

regarding the corpus:
- question about the limitation on corpus: source code poems vs. esolangs vs. everything

#### III - broad questions

we can make a parallel between enunciation (bakhtine) and programming langauges (python, js, etc.), in that programming languages are themselves a sort of materiality

*code is the only language that is executable* -> find what are the formal/aesthetic features that surround (i.e. precede and follow from) this executability... i.e. the syntax and grammar of executability

- code is definitely taken into account
- - source code poems as artistic practices (limited very much on perl)
- - obfuscation practices
- - source code as a "concept", sourcery from chun, magic from cramer
- - source code as a speech object

- there is a possibility to develop a new vision on literature by looking at languages themselves

camille paloque berges focuses on the mode of production of these works (the network), and i would like to focus on the **mode of representation** of these works (the computation)

the rhetorical uses of programming languages (code is more and more identified, less and less obfuscated, so there is room for closer examination)

what kind of linearity does code have? how does it requalify our understanding of linearity?

the differences between code and computation? gap between execution and expression (or the other way around)?

**definition of software??**

use of mental models

#### IV - next steps

**what should i read next? things i know: programming language textbooks, and other things like marxist lit crit**

gerard genette
annette vee - coding literacy
