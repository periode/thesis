## from the previous doc

The immediate next aspect that I will be focusing on is therefore to highlight the aesthetic criteria which support two other communities of practice: **hackers** and **artists**.

## the overarching point

aesthetics matter, even in such a highly formal, syntactical, autotelic system as a computer

how does it contribute to the world? by showing that there is no separate domain of aesthetics, but also that they're not essential, but a mark of high-quality

## 0 - main points

first i want to touch upon cursory work in source code poetry (paloque berges), and connect that to metaphor and literary tradition. then i want to talk about hacking (demoscene, folies, one-liners), and then connect that lack of aesthetic concern (qualify! different kinds of aesthetics) to the question of "what is there to understand" and therefore the question of **semantics**. i will close by exploring the different concepts in programming that are hard to communicate.

**CONCEPT**: semantic compression

**CONCEPT**: spatio-visual problem solving

**CONCEPT**: concepts to communicate? the stream? the map?

this is not so much about code aligning with standards of literature, but maybe aligning to the standards of both epistemology and architecture, *architectural knowledge*

## source code poems

### short analysis of the scene

### analysis of a poem

- lit review
- double-meaning

---

## the place of metaphor

### overall metaphor in lit

### imagination and metaphor in code

### mental structure / mental models

- add the part on psychology of programming

transition: metaphors as architecture of thought

---

## the connection to architecture (and style/structure)

### talk about general software architecture

### connect with alexander's pattersn

### preliminary exploration of how well that concept would apply to different corpuses

transition: folies and hacking

---

## hacking

beauty in inscrutability?

Hackers -> this redirects to the understanding of the machine (e.g. trying to reduce character counts for one-liners)

## beautiful languages (PL theory/research)

### short overview of programming languages

ADD what makes a good PL vs. what makes a good symbol system?

### formal symbol systems

good part: fits with goodman

bad part: no meaning

## semantics in PL

### do PL have semantics? no.

### where do those semantics come from? what do they need to represent

### concepts

things that make programs complicated to understand

## cognitive aesthetics

### traditional ones

## cognitive aspects

the MIT study on reading code:

> The emphasis placed on the symbolic, cognitive, planning aspects of the arts leads us to give value to the role played by problem-solving, seeing there a model in terms of which the moment-to-moment artist’s behavior at work can be described. “An analysis of behavior as a sequence of problem- solving and planning activities seems to be most promising [...]" (goodman)
