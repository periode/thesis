> flow state needs an immediate feedback in order to be achieved: literary writing does not have that, but computer writing, with IDEs, linters, etc. does have immediate feedback (with execution speed, so i guess it changes over the years as well) (clemens)

from thought to practice: conceptual art aims at communicating concepts, ideas. experimental art don't know what they aim at but are motivated by an aesthetic criteria. (richard gabriel, keynote science is not enough) maybe this connects to the tension between having to be understood by humans and understood by computers? [[table_of_contents#understanding code]]

the distance calculation in the interpreting step of programming language compilation to resolve a variable (i.e. scoping) and the fact that one uses shorter variable names based on inner scope, is such example of a connection between literary and architecture

minimalism is not the same thing as simplicity and clarity
