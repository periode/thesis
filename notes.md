## reading and writing

there could be different beauties in writing and in reading (case of Mike's APL) - easier to read vs. easier to type

> My personal style guide is to copy Erlang: double quotes for text, single quotes for programmatic strings (atoms/symbols). The single quote is slightly more convenient to type on a qwerty keyboard, but text regularly contains single quotes (apostrophes). It also provides a semantic visual shortcut. 

I like the concept of **semantic visual shortcut**, also **semantic compression** (developed [here](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015))

## meeting with advisors

questions:

- categories of people are relevant? should i look into academic as well? i'm afraid there might not be so much information/sources
- the difference between syntactical and semantic metaphors?
- would you like to see the corpus? how should i display/save it?
- are metaphors contributing to the research project? should i stick to the functional part of aesthetics.

the intent overall is to see to what extent there is an overlap between each
