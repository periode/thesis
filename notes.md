france culture cours du collège de france  de francois chatelet: la condition necessaire du savoir c'est la sensibilité (tout se donne dans la spatio-temporalité)

3. raison, qui remonte jusqu'a la cause originelle, le principe

[computer architecture as a mix between text, building, and math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFT54hO1X8M)

three theories for computer science: [acm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11023-007-9060-8), the conceptual object one could be interesting/promising

> flow state needs an immediate feedback in order to be achieved: literary writing does not have that, but computer writing, with IDEs, linters, etc. does have immediate feedback (with execution speed, so i guess it changes over the years as well) (clemens)

from thought to practice: conceptual art aims at communicating concepts, ideas. experimental art don't know what they aim at but are motivated by an aesthetic criteria. (richard gabriel, keynote science is not enough) maybe this connects to the tension between having to be understood by humans and understood by computers? [[table_of_contents#understanding code]]

the distance calculation in the interpreting step of programming language compilation to resolve a variable (i.e. scoping) and the fact that one uses shorter variable names based on inner scope, is such example of a connection between literary and architecture

minimalism is not the same thing as simplicity and clarity

> There are two well-known sides to programming: (1)  mastery of the domain; and (2) mastery of the formalisms by  which intentions become executable by computers (we call  these programming languages). Crista Lopes in [this panel](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2814189.2818719)

## rewrite

~~should i also specify in the intro that i'm dealing with aesthetics and not art? isn't that obvious enough already?~~

- include a fuller discussion of both rhetorical code studies (brock) and critical code studies (marino)

[the programmer's brain (preview)](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain) -> However, your brain does a lot more while you are reading the BASIC program. You are mentally trying to execute the code, to understand what is happening. That process is called **tracing**—the mental compiling and executing of code, and differentiates one from novice or expert
