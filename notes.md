# notes - fall 2020

## introduction

who is going to be impacted by this? how does it create discussion/connection?

- literary theorists, for broadening scope and designers (as other functional artists)
- practicioners, to deepen the understanding of the potential beauty of the work, and its use
- for a more minute criticism to judge the quality of something (a book or a program)

Elegance: Through a single lens, it communicates the problem it solves and the machinery of its solution.

Implementation as: **THIS GOES WITH GOODMAN**

- individuation (from homo sapiens to delia derbyshire)
- instantiation (from turing machine to macbook)
- exemplification (from red to a specific acrylic)
- reduction (from complex weather model to weather forecast)

https://vimeo.com/47364930 -> concise code is code as litterature, because he says one of the issues is that there are just too many lines of code that one can wrap its head around. so there's a need for shrinking down content

when i talk about materiality, i should also contextualize it with other materialities (build processes, hardware, etc)

ARCH:

alexander vs. eisenman

alexander = softdev, habitable vs. eisenman = hack, subversion

design thinking book: The concept of good in architecture is one which says, among other things, that all architecture must engage its audience. It must foster understanding and be intelligible. This is clearly not the only concept necessarily at work, but it is one that would have broad adherence, across positions.

http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/NNJ/conferences/N2004-Diaz.html - beauty in math and arch

beauty in math: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology

simplicity: Syntactic simplicity, or elegance, measures the number and conciseness of the theory's basic principles. Ontological simplicity, or parsimony, measures the number of kinds of entities postulated by the theory. code is syntactic simplicity because wrngles together complex concepts (e.g. perl, one liners), or code is ontological simplicity, because all is within computation (e.g. lisp)

los pequenos glazier, code as language: "There are other spatialities key to writerly programming. Decisions such as whether copies of objects are used in new contexts or existing objects are overwritten, recursion, the articulate realities of arrays, and the energized antics of loops within loops, are a decisive part of the logic of programs"

tension between literature and architecture: **expression** statement vs. **block** statement

`GOTO` as proof of spatialization

## reading and writing

there could be different beauties in writing and in reading (case of Mike's APL) - easier to read vs. easier to type

## aesthetic analysis

> My personal style guide is to copy Erlang: double quotes for text, single quotes for programmatic strings (atoms/symbols). The single quote is slightly more convenient to type on a qwerty keyboard, but text regularly contains single quotes (apostrophes). It also provides a semantic visual shortcut.

I like the concept of **semantic visual shortcut**, also **semantic compression** (developed [here](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015))

this could be an interesting theory about the reading process: [https://www.fabula.org/actualites/luigi-pareyson-esthetique-theorie-de-la-formativite_21236.php]

this is not so much about code aligning with standards of literature, but maybe aligning to the standards of both epistemology and architecture, *architectural knowledge*

## programming languages

> when we talk about esolangs, we are designing a perspective for someone to think through. -daniel temkin [src](https://www.artistsandhackers.org/Critical-Code)

> There's a lot of attention to **COMPRESSION**, using the underlying programming language in a way that's easy to penetrate - richard gabriel [src](https://www.dreamsongs.com/PoetryOfProgramming.html)

conceptual art aims at communicating concepts, ideas. experimental art don't know what they aim at but are motivated by an aesthetic criteria. (richard gabriel, keynote science is not enough)

the question of operational meaning vs. denotational meaning should be explored. what means what to the computer? (and what is the role of the stack in this whole thing)

procedural rhetoric is just a very high level of programming semantics. processes with meaning assigned to it. <- this further extends the gradient.

a class within a class [link](https://blog.royalsloth.eu/posts/the-complexity-that-lives-in-the-gui/) is a visual/spatio-mental pattern which means "complexity", "unmaintainability", "unsustainability"

bad patterns make possible the kind of actions which result in bad patterns?

Abstraction in programming is the process of identifying common patterns that have systematic variations; an abstraction represents the common pattern and provides a means for specifying which variation to use. An abstraction facilitates separation of concerns: The implementor of an abstraction can ignore the exact uses or instances of the abstraction, and the user of the abstraction can forget the details of the implementation of the abstraction, so long as the implementation fulfills its intention or specification. (Balzer et al. 1989)

**Compression** is the characteristic of a piece of text that the meaning of any part of it is “larger” than that particular piece has by itself. This characteristic is created by a rich context, with each part of the text drawing on that context—each word draws part of its meaning from its surroundings.
**Piecemeal growth** is the process of design and implementation in which software is embellished, modified, reduced, enlarged, and improved through a process of repair rather than of replacement

## meeting with advisors

questions:

- would you like to see the corpus? how should i display/save it?

- categories of people are relevant? should i look into academic as well? i'm afraid there might not be so much information/sources

- are metaphors contributing to the research project? should i stick to the functional part of aesthetics.

- the difference between syntactical and semantic metaphors?

the intent overall is to see to what extent there is an overlap between each of those communities of practice

next steps:

- do the same with code poetry for this semester
- also look at hackers
- what about mathematic/academic beauty?
- perfect the aspect of readability (luigi pareyson? umberto eco/the open work?)
  - psychology of programming
