elegant: characterized by a lack of the gratuitous

clever source code can be/often is?/ bad for maintainability

OOP: encapsulation and modularity are good things, but not axioms of goodness

> acknowledges the influence of programming languages on elegance

*"in pursuing elegance, it is more important to be **concise** than to be **brief**!"* -> highlight the difference between these two terms

lambda takes to make for simpler programs.

difference between the *useless* and the *gratuitous* (gratuitous is good)

also **underlying assumptions** that influence standards of elegance

*"The more a language lets you define the language youâ€™re using on the fly, the more likely it is to allow an excellent programmer to produce elegance, which should really be the end goal of writing code, generally speaking: elegant solutions."*

is it really necessary? is it functionally desirable?

difference between *pretty* and *elegant*? elegant could touch at the substance of the program, while pretty is really just formatting, additional spaces, tabs, etc.
