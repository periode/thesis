# the aeshetics of generative code
## geoff cox, alex mclean, adrian ward

- a need to "sense" the code in order to appreciate fully the aesthetics of digital art
- if aesthetics is "sense perception", what kind of senses are at play when reading code? the brain> because it needs to be contextualized within the world of ideas (what aristotle called *common sense*)

*It is this operative function that is an essential of part of the experience of poetry* (the fact that when you execute it, it does something)

- code has nuances (make it more or less readable)

Evidently, code works like poetry in that it plays with structures of language itself, as well as our corresponding perceptions (the word order helps the author highlight the emphasis, the important parts)

*Code is a notation of an internal structure that the computer is executing, expressing ideas, logic, and decisions that operate as an extension of the author's intentions.*

if one must experience both the code and the product of code simultaneously, it is the latter that is much better understood, and therefore i should focus on *what is the experience of writing/reading source code*, in order to develop a literacy of SC.
