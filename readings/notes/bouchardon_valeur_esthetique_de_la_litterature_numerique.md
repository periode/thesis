# valeur heuristique de la litterature numerique

### intro

digital literature exists in the wake of things like:
- combinatorial lit (oulipo)
- constraint lit (idem)
- fragment lit (?)
- audio/visual lit

literary experiments (-> which implies that the experiment is the first intent, no? could it be that art flourishes on the margin, like the hacker code of paloque berges?)

literary expression: writing, narrative, position of the reader

**what has source code writing to offer when it comes to literary creation?** (and vice-versa)

the digital only refers to itself (yes, but the digital is inseparable from the act of writing, which then involves a human and therefore necessarily (?) a relationship to other worlds). but also the very first thing is hardware

form and meaning are closely linked (cf. j. rousset, *forme et signification*, 1966)

the bizarre love triangle of media studies:
- **technically**
- **semiotically**
- **socially**

- the theoretical object (theory) vs./and the technical object (source code)
- the observable reality (form) vs./and the inner practice (interpretation)
- kind of production (the work) vs./and a political ideal (the limits of computability?)


source code could be a *particular modality/mode* of text (now i need to define which one!)

### mark marino: critical code studies!

*"possesses aesthetic properties everything which sets in motion, which makes do (fait faire)"*

relationship between literature and communication??

*"the interrogative stance can not only stand in what has been done, but also in what can be anticipated, through conception and creation"* (epistemological constructivism, hacking, 1983). *"the creative moment sets up the conditions to observe a phenomenon"*

### the digital lit object


halfway between the concrete object that belong in the observation field and the scientific object which has alread-established explanations of the real

the digital lit object is complex: need to explicit these webs of relationships (historical, geographical, means vs. ends, broadcasting techniques); it stands at the frontier of a lot of domains.

in the poetic dimension of technical objects, there is this idea that, as we realize a technical object, new ideas appear and transform the initial project. **it is a literature OF the technical apparatus**.

is there really a tension between the imperative formal semantics of programming and the cultural forms of writing? writing is an apparatus of externalizing memory and thought, while the program is *"a means to certify the future, to eliminate uncertainty and the unlikely in order to bring it back under control, mastery"*. (while i don't see this as a tension), the author says that out of this initial seemingly-impossibility. (closeness of the program, openness of the language)

question of the *architectural literature*. <<<

**L'INTERSEMIOTISATION DU LANGUAGE ET DU TEXTE** (how these systems of signs interact with each other)

the aesthetic experience can result from the tension between materiality and the revelation of meaning/direction (transcendance). it is a bit like the double-coding that CPB was talking about, but perhaps could be extended by defining (precise/multiple) what materiality and transcendentality; but nonetheless advancing an aesthetics of materiality.

dual-positioning of source code text
1. against text (literary)
2. against text (productive software)
