# valeur heuristique de la litterature numerique
## serge bouchardon

digital literature exists in the wake of things like:
- combinatorial lit (oulipo)
- constraint lit (idem)
- fragment lit (?)
- audio/visual lit

literary experiments (-> which implies that the experiment is the first intent, no? could it be that art flourishes on the margin, like the hacker code of paloque berges?)

literary expression: writing, narrative, position of the reader

**what has source code writing to offer when it comes to literary creation?** (and vice-versa)

the digital only refers to itself (yes, but the digital is inseparable from the act of writing, which then involves a human and therefore necessarily (?) a relationship to other worlds). but also the very first thing is hardware

form and meaning are closely linked (cf. j. rousset, *forme et signification*, 1966)

the bizarre love triangle of media studies:
- **technically**
- **semiotically**
- **socially**

- the theoretical object (theory) vs./and the technical object (source code)
- the observable reality (form) vs./and the inner practice (interpretation)
- kind of production (the work) vs./and a political ideal (the limits of computability?)


source code could be a *particular modality/mode* of text (now i need to define which one!)

### mark marino: critical code studies!

*"possesses aesthetic properties everything which sets in motion, which makes do (fait faire)"*

relationship between literature and communication??

*"the interrogative stance can not only stand in what has been done, but also in what can be anticipated, through conception and creation"* (epistemological constructivism, hacking, 1983). *"the creative moment sets up the conditions to observe a phenomenon"*
