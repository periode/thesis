# le demon de la theorie

paul de man: *le principal interet theorique de la theorie litteraire consiste dans l'impossibilite de sa definition* > negative approach (it is neither just technique or just pedagogy, even though theory is often turned into method by academic institutions).
there is theory when the givens of ordinary discourse are questioned, exposed as historical constructions.

literary theory is interesting because of the fights it leads against common sense (even though these ideas of common sense, these "popular" definitions of literature remain before and after theories).

answers go and questions remain

what is the code, the behaviour, the *praxis* that literary theories codify, organizes? it is that of literary studies/criticsm/research. **it is to focus on literature in general, from a point of view that aims at the universal**

difference between philosophy of literature and theory of literature:
- philosophy: abstract, speculative
- theory: analytical, topical. its objects are discourses on lit, history and criticism of literature

*une theorie dirait la verite d'une pratique, enoncerait ses conditions de possibilites*, it is about analyzing those literary practices, finding their assumptions, giving them a framework.
