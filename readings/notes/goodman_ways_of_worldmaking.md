# ways of worldmaking

### hackett, 1978

a book about the fact that there are always multiple worlds made from existing worlds, and about how to define which worlds are "true" or "good", and which ones aren't.

#### words, works, worlds

there is no one one world, and if there are multiple worlds, there can always be seen as a collection of *one*.

so how do we define them, if there is no perception without conception, and no conception without perception?

if we look at worldmaking in developmental sociology or anthropology, a universal or necessary beginning is best found in theology.

processes of worldmaking are:

- **composition and decomposition (pp.7-9)**
- - taking apart, separating, analyzing complex components into simple features, etc.
- - changing predicates (e.g. applying something usually related to taste to sight) -> **changing metaphors**  (he calls that metaphorical transfer)
- - the question isn't "same or not the same" but "same *what*"? -> worlds aren't different, but they *differ*
- - taking apart also implies **reassorting into kinds**
- **weighting**
- - given things that are present in several worlds, some might be presented as very relevant, and others as completely irrelevant, through *emphasis* and *accent*
- - these emphases are based on the departure from the relative prominence accorded to the several features in the current world of our everyday seeing.
- - hierarchies rather than dichotomies
- **ordering**
- - what is first, and what is derived
- - spatial order of a map vs. temporal sequence of a trip
- - order is not *found into the world* but rather *built into it* (e.g. hours, seconds, millenia)
- **deletion and supplementation**
- - supplementation is the whole from the fragments (gestalt)
- **reshapings and deformation**
- - which can be considered either corrections or distortions, depending on the point of view

> works of arts, though, characteristically illustrate, rather than name or describe relevant kinds. (p.11)

> Exemplification and expression, though running in the opposite direction from denotation—that is, from the symbol to a literal or metaphorical feature of it instead of to something the symbol applies to—are no less symbolic referential functions and instruments of worldmaking." (p.12)

criteria for success in making a world:

- when it offends none of its unyielding beliefs (e.g. laws of logic, laws of physics, morals, immediately preceding observations) own precepts (i.e. is not self-contradictory in its chosen frames of reference)
- it's not so much about *truth* as it is about *rightness*
- and yet, while truth and reality might be relative, there is also the fact that some worlds are "false", do not provide anything worth fighting for or against. (*"a broad mind is no substitute for hard work"*)

knowing is about finding a *fit*, about **the advancement in understanding**, and **comprehension and creation go together**

> As meanings vanish in favor of  certain relationships among terms, so fads vanish in favor of  certain relationships among versions. (p. 93)

facts depend on habit

recognizable -> *re-cognizable*

> The artist's resources-modes of reference, literal and  nonliteral. linguistic and nonlinguistic, denotational and non­ denotational, in many media-seem more varied and impressive  than the scientist. But the scientist is also poetic.
