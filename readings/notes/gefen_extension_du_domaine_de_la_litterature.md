- problem of the uniqueness of "litterarity", of the identity of literature
- each text was supposed to be approached mostly historically, as a single entity, with its most important part being "originality", and escaped any relation to the rest of the world

today, we think we've moved away from self-referentiality, from formalism, from *the canon*. but in reality, not so much.

if there is chronological extension, what other kinds of extensions are there? because it extends between journalism and literature, anthropology and literature, history and literature... it def goes beyond *fiction*.

- it is no longer a matter of pointing out the specificities of the literary in certain texts, but highlight those that question this specificities. that live indeed at the boundary.

- literature studied through the lens of "problems" (feminism, exile, memory, etc.), a practical perspective.
- literature studied not as a set of *texts* but as a set of *activities*. it even gets closer to a study of a particular media (the written text), a study of particular supports/materials

- in order to get out of this "trap", one should look into multiple interpretations of the literary fact, coming from cognitive sciences, cultural anthropology, or educational theories (goodman/**dewey talking about how literature should be a means rather than an end**)
