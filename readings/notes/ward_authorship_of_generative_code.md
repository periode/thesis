# the authorship of generative art
## adrian ward, geoff cox

*To have a machine write poetry for ten years would not generate creative music, but the process of getting the machine to do so would certainly register an advanced form of creativity.*

the code could be seen to be more like the chaos mathematics used to simulate complex systems than a mathematical formula like pi > MODELS AND THEORIES (cf. weizenbaum)

source code is *decision*, not *action*.

more benjamin:

*'An author who has carefully thought about the conditions of production today... will never be concerned with the products alone, but always, at the same time, with the means of production. In other words, his [sic] products must possess an organizing function besides and before their character as finished works.'*

By programming computers to undertake creative instructions, it is possible to argue for more accurate and expansive traces of creativity that suitablymerge artistic subjectivity, social context with technical form.

*If both humans and machines are conceived as coded devices, the computer programmer works in a tradition of a bricoleur in the assemblage and hacking of code, rearranging its structural elements. Coding is the ability to make judgements and render those as logic; for programming has always been about solving problems using logic. If we could resolve our creative impulses as series of logical decisions, we could code them. Yet, subjectivity is embedded in the social system like code itself. Its manipulation therefore is crucial to effective programming and an understanding of ideological processes.*
