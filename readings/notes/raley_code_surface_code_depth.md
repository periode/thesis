# code.surface || code.depth

apparently the impetus of contemporary code art is to reveal codes, to make the mechanism of production visible to the viewer

bringing code out is not just proving the "code is law" of lessig, but also shows ties to free software/open-source

Hans Dieter Huber, the notion that code is a deep structure that instantiates a surface:  *"In principle, all of the Internet-based works are based on the difference between code and surface.  The source code represents a kind of notation or musical score that is interpreted by the computer when a page is called up by a specific browser such as Netscape, Internet Explorer or Opera.  Like a virtual conductor or a symphony orchestra, the browser performs the score and displays it on the surface of the monitor.  What we see is only the surface of a specific interpretation."*

including `||` in an english text invites the reader to think in a different way

according to her, code has a dual audience: human (pretend) and machine (genuine)

What the façade of the code surface masks is the deep structure of code, the tower of programming languages that descend from software to hardware.

depth = layers = layers of abstraction
- they appeared with **structured programming** and **abstract data types**.

*CENTRAL QUESTION*  **How have the metaphors of software engineering – particularly the notion of structured layers and multitier architectures – been put to artistic use?**
(building on more examples like this)

programming languages provide symbolic action on top of actual action
