# coding praxis - reconsidering the aesthetics of code
## geoff cox, alex mclean, 2004

about the performativity of code, because the starting assumption is *speech*, while my starting assumption could be that code is *writing*. why are we trying to focus on speech? (that's another problem haha)

art-orientated programming needs to acknowledge the conditions of its own making -its poiesis. These are both technical and cultural (and semiotical!)

generative art / generative grammar: the deep-seated rules by which language operates

linguistics needs an abstract system demonstrating competence ("langue"), that generates the concrete event/performance ("parole").

- creative production is performative, so the act of writing by the programmer is also performative.

*he written form is merely a computer-readable notation of logic, and is a representation of this process. Yet the written code isn’t what the computer really executes, since there are many levels of interpreting and compiling and linking taking place. Code is only really understandable within the context of its overall structure — which is what makes it like a language*

software formalism (only the object, pure)
software culturalism (in the web of society)

*Benjamin recommends that the ‘cultural producer’ intervene in the production process, in order to transform the apparatus. Clearly this is not pure
form (nor simply free nor open) but a decidedly dirty form of critical engagement appropriate to the political task of exposing hidden exploitation in order to change it for the better.*

there is a risk of aestheticisation of code (i.e. making code pretty in order to obfuscate its real inner workings), in opposition to a code of aesthetics (i.e. a use of aesthetics in order to grasp code better) *art-orientated programming/program-orientated art*

fuller: critical / social / speculative (speculative also in the sense that it exists first in the programmer's head)

then a long part on live performance, and on code that can modify itself (performative, generative, etc.)

tool: extension of the human body
machine: automation of a task

*Praxis is a self-creating action informed by theory, and therefore thoroughly active and dynamic.*

Adorno: **a successful work of art [...] is not one that resolves objective contradictions in a spurious harmony, but one that expresses the idea of harmony negatively by embodying the contradictions, pure and uncompromised, in its innermost structure.**
