# a box, darkly: obfuscation, weird languages, and code aesthetics
## michael mateas, nick montfort

different values than clarity and elegance as an aesthetic standard

- focus on obfuscation+esoteric as a practice
- the use of internal models when writing code

the aesthetic "abuse"

1. naming obfuscation
2. pointer confusion
3. data/code confusion
4. double-coding

obfuscation is an exploration of play *within* a language, commenting on the language itself, but it could also exploit the conditions within which (a) the language exists and (b) we exist

*"A quality [weird languages] share with obfuscated code is that they often ironically commenton features of existing, traditional languages."*

1. parody, spoof, commentary on language features
2. minimalism
3. structured play to encourage double-coding

*“Good” code simultaneously specifies a mechanical process and talks about this mechanical process to a human reader*

introduces the notion of **literary code** but does not define it.
