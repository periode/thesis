# speech, writing, code: three woldviews
## n. katherine hayles

3 worldviews, with code affecting speech and writing (legacy systems)

**the regime of computation**

- code is addressed to both humans and machines

*for code, complexity inheres neither in the origin nor in the operation of difference, but in the labor of computation that again and again calculates differences to create complexity as an emergent property of computation* calculating differences: always already specific, through implementation: that is, the event in which abstract computation **takes place**.

saussure believes that relationship between signifier and signified are wholly arbitrary and therefore speech is only historically first to writing, but derrida instead says that because of the material conditions of productions, there is always a *first writing* that preceded any speech (which i assume is a sort of formal, material pre-requisite?). in any case, material constraints are even more important in computers.

on comparisons: *here too i expect the discontinuities to be as revealing as the continuities*

derrida's differance, or trace, i understand as *the implication of*. the implication doesn't exist positively, it is always towards something else, making this something else exist by the very absence of the substance of the implication.

floating signifiers vs. rigid code

citability and iterability (properties detected by derrida for all written forms/languages) exist in code, notably through polymorphism and inheritance)

the human brain is also a platform on which computer code runs

not sure when she says the open source movement is akin to the gift economy...

she also cares about code insofar as it includes (potentially non-backwards compatible) versioning of languages and environments

both valid in lit and code:
**syntagmatic**: across the words of a sentence (syntax) (in lit: always there, in code: always dynamically generated)
**paradigmatic**: across the potential synonyms for the same sentence. (in lit: always potential, in code: always there)


**there is a virtuality in code** and one must dig deeper into what this (the more discreet information, the more space for potentialities > simple rules, complex behaviour (and big data!)) >> **layers of language that reveal themselves**

code as the lingua franca of nature? as leibniz's wet dream?

*It is not the triumph of the Regime of Computation that can best explain the complexities of the world and, especially, of human cultures but its interactions with the stories we tell and the media technologies instrumental in making, storing, and transmitting.*

- the act of making discrete (is inherent to code)

- the very important role of object-oriented programming (`abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance`) in differing from writing and speech. **they anatomize/cut up/dissect the problems they are created to solve**

**there is no parallel to compiling in speech or writing, much less a distinction between compiling and runtime**


the linguistic practices of humans and intelligence machines influence and interpenetrate each other

code as language's partner
