- intermingling human and machine

*code is anything that combines tokens and syntax to represent a domain*, but without anomalies or fuzziness (inshallah)

1. syntactical interplay of surface language (playful, mixed)
2. continuous surface deformation through (sometimes appearing) code
3. deformation through clearly appearing code

"the simulacrum of programs"
