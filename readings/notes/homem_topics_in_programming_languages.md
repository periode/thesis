### chartridge, 2013

looking at the philosophy of computation through the duality of programming languages and natural languages

this is a lot of philosophy + math + programming languages as mutual structures reconciling the content and form paradox, but also highlighting the role of *functions* in both math, philo and prog languages. if lambda calculus is formalized mathematics, then it is another way to reach leibniz through church turing hypothesis? (it was actually invented by alonzo church)

he looks at the switch from *calculus* to *computus*: effective calculability within general incompleteness

also, this seems to be a deep philosophy phd thesis, not sure it's relevant right now (15.02.2020)
