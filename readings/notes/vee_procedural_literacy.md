it's a book review of bogost and wardruip-fruin

using literacy and rhetoric to understand "playable media"

-> matthew kirschenbaum *Mechanics*

#### bogost

the problemt isn't with processes or computers per se, but with the simplified version of processes that they enact

videogames can help people reconcile abstract principles with specific practices // rhetorical positions are always *particular* positions

the "simulation gap" is when players can interrogate the representation of the system with their own notions of the system.

procedural rhetorics expose the way things work.

expressive processing: "internal processes of digital media are designed artifacts" and they "operate both on and in terms of humanly meaningful elements and structures"
