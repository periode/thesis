there is an extreme between computers understanding english and humans understanding c++

hence, the need for a compomise

semantic: meaning
syntactic: role

> In fact, one of the biggest differences between object-oriented and non-object-oriented programming is the possibility to identify the actor of an action using purely syntactic means.

semantic roles should have syntactic distinctions

> The point here is to understand that unreasonable introduction of natural-language traits into programming languages may bring not only benefits, but problems as well.

> I have deliberately restricted myself to syntax, as this is the only field of linguistics that is felt to be integral part of computer science. However there are still other fields that can give equally interesting results. Semantics, morphology or lexicology, for example.
