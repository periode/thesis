# on intellectual craftsmanship

## c. wright mills

the development of experience, and reliance on experience, is key to accomplished intellectual craftsmanship (little distinction between life and work)

keeping notes keeps track of ideas and develops into... books/wholes

His example on mosca is interesting both in its contents and in its form. it critically analyzes what the author (mosca) is saying, laying out methodological steps to further build upon. This building upon is done either by improving the good ideas, or correctly refuting the bad ones. Formally, the sentences are well-written, and it oscillates between clear, formal, academic language to slangs and interpellations. I can also see a lot of question marks, sequential bullet points leading up to the methodological inquiries aforementioned.

(I really wonder how the computer affects note-takingâ€”and whether it's a time-sensitive study?)

I disagree with his statement that empirical research has to be a strict second to structuring. They should/could both progress alongside one another. (He says a little further that empirical studies must have implications for the theoretical structures)

> Unexpected relevance

(serendipity of sorts, amplified by notes)

Once you start getting into a topic, you realize the topic gets into you, and comes along on every thought. Each topic seems to imbue the world.

stinulating (research) imagination:

- reorganizing notes in different folders
- relaxed browsing in the library
- adopting different perspectives (psychologist, historian, statistician (they seem to be from close, or related fields))
- viewing both sides of the argument
- an attitude of playfulness with the lexicon used, but also a rigor in finding all connotations of a word
- break down high-level statements into concrete steps
- coming up with typologies (and thinking through its origins and consequences)
- make comparisons with other places, eras, domains

> Thinking is a continuous struggle between conceptual order and empirical comprehensiveness

We always try to juggle a clear mental model with the fact that it might be brought down by *immediate** empirical contradictions.
