# cutting code: on software and sociality
## adrian mckenzie

- sociological, STS

software as social object and process

*technical practices and contexts of software interlace with cultural practices and contexts*

formalism: software is just relation and operations

an ontology is like a formal specification of a program, describing concepts and relationships, but anthropology and sociology always need "situated practices"

attribution of agency is a precondition of any social relation whatsoever. software has *secondary* agency, in that it extends the agency of the programmer/hacker/corporation.

code involes:
1. index (it indicates (or hides) something)
2. originators (producers)
3. recipients (humans/machines)
4. prototypes (simulations -i find this category a bit narrow, all a computer does is simulate)

but none of these are clearly delimited between one and the other

he says that code poetry is kitsch art, the computing equivalent of dabbling in paint by numbers -> i think there is much more to that, that it is possible to write code-specific poems, rather than as refractions of human languages

how are software artists different from code poets?

*Code may in a general sense be opaque and legible only to specialists, much like a cave painting's sign system, but it has been inscribed, programmed, written.  It is conditioned and concretely historical.  Whether or not non-human agents have had a 'hand' in its formulation, code remains not only a constructing force but also that which is constructed.*

Highly recursive. extreme programming treats "the program" as both the object and model of work.

**every programming language is already an ontology**
