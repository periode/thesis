mostly a book about NLP, CS & linguistics. a prequel to *understanding computers and cognition*.

#### 1. Viewing Language as a Knowledge-Based Process

rules to understand language (p.8):

- word order rules (syntax)
- vocabulary and word structure
- semantic features (a classification system of which a language user must be aware of)
- reference (e.g. what does it imply? difference between *a* city and *the* city)
- time (past, present, future)
- discourse structure (overall coherence)
- attitude messages (e.g. rhetorical question)
- prosody (intonation, inflexion, etc.)
- style conventions
- world knowledge <- **this might be interesting, since programming is about world representation**

survey of linguistic history:

- prescriptive grammar, or linguistics as law. language as an enforced set of rules, focused on correctness or purity. is mostly wrong (for obv reasons)
- comparative grammar, or linguistics as biology/natural history. language as compared to other languages, to other linguistic structures, grouped in taxonomies, etc.)
- structural linguistics, or liinguistics as chemistry. language as made up of individual, structuring components (saussure)
- generative linguistics, or linguistics as mathematics. language as the result of the combinatorial mental capacities of the speaker (chomsky). the central problem is to define the *grammar* of a language (the set of procedures which confirm a statement as valid/true).

the view of the book is that **language is a communicative process based on knowledge**. that's because programming languages often seem to based on *computational linguistics*, or language as formal symbol manipulation (which turned out not to be true. or at least not effective compared to ML approaches)

the basic assumption is that there are *mental representations* in the user which can be represented as *data structures* in the computer.

if linguistic structure is stratified, eache strate still relates and connects to the stratas around it. this is related to the idea of *abstraction*

sounds <- -> phonemes <- -> morphemes <- -> words <- -> syntax <- -> representations

(note: in *idioms*, it seems that words related directly to meaning rather than also word structure)

there is also a difference between:

- long-term knowledge and temporary knowledge
- procedural representation (algorithm based) and declarative representation (data-structure based)

approaches of linguistics can focus on:

- text
- individual
- social

**which of the above do i choose?** (should i even choose? i'm guessing it's quite obviously *text* since i'm focusing on source code)

limitations, because language is:

- social
- evocative (aesthetics? def. literature)
- historical (re. social)
